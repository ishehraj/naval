Figure out what you’re uniquely good at, and apply as much leverage as possible

**Nivi:** You summarized this entire tweetstorm with two words: “[Productize yourself.](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1003356436091400192?lang=en)”

**Naval:** Productize has specific knowledge and leverage. Yourself has uniqueness and accountability. Yourself also has specific knowledge. So you can combine all of these pieces into these two words.

If you’re looking towards the long-term, you should ask yourself, “Is this authentic to me? Is it myself that I’m projecting?” And then, “Am I productizing it? Am I scaling it? Am I scaling with labor or capital or code or media?” It’s a very handy, simple mnemonic.

What is this podcast? This is a podcast called Naval. I’m literally productizing myself with a podcast.

**Nivi:** You want to figure out what you’re uniquely good at—or what you uniquely are— and apply as much leverage as possible. So making money isn’t even something you do. It’s not a skill. It’s who you are, stamped out a million times.

**Find hobbies that make you rich, fit and creative**

**Naval:** Making money should be a function of your identity and what you like to do. Another tweet I really liked was, “[Find three hobbies: One that makes you money, one that keeps you fit, and one that makes you creative.](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=Find+three+hobbies:+One+that+makes+you+money,+one+that+keeps+you+fit,+and+one+that+makes+you+creative&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)”

I would change that slightly. I would say: One that makes you money, one that makes you fit, and one that makes you smarter. So in my case, my hobbies would be reading and making money, as I love working with startups, investing in them, brainstorming them, starting them. I love the ideation and initial creation phase around startups.

On the hobby that keeps you fit, I don’t really have one. The closest thing I have is yoga, but that’s where I sort of fell apart. I think people who, early in life, discover something like surfing or swimming or tennis or some kind of a sport they continue doing throughout most of their life are very lucky, because they found a hobby that will make them fit.
