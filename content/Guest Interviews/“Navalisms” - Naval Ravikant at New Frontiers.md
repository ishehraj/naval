In terms of digital literacy. I think that, uh, computers are the most powerful tool ever created by humanity. Um, they've they allow for infinite leverage without permission. And, uh, to me that, uh, knowing how to be good with computers is the modern literacy. It's like the new reading, writing, arithmetic, and this will be widely accepted and acknowledged decades from now.

But today we're in that transition. Yeah, immigration is interesting because I think people look at Silicon valley and they say, how can we create a Silicon valley here? Um, and that's an experiment that's been tried all over the world. Um, but really, uh, Silicon valley is not a place that creates entrepreneurs or wealth or technology.

It is a place that attracts entrepreneurs who create wealth and technology. And, uh, and so it's really an attractor function. So intelligent immigration policy is actually the largest wealth creator in the world. It's the nature of technology that the destructive power arrives before the creative power, uh, you get to.

Have a nuclear weapon before you get to have a functioning, safe nuclear plant, you get to have a, you know, the, you get the, uh, unfortunately in social media you get combat before he gets civil discourse. Uh, so it's it's even if you go back through human history, you get gunpowder before. Uh, steam engines and airplanes.

So it's just, unfortunately the nature of technology that the disruptive and that associate power arrives first. So I think it's completely fine to use an entrepreneur as a source of inspiration, but I think it's silly to use them as a source of truth. Right? Like, in fact, it's silly that I'm up here and I'm kind of giving you all this so-called truth and really, I just have very nice.

Specialization in a very narrow set of things, but somehow for some reason, somebody wants to hear my opinion and everything. Uh, that's the cult of personality kind of poking through, but still you've got to pick some monkey to get in front of the tribe, you know, at various points. So it's my turn right now.

I got into, uh, cryptocurrencies and blockchains back in 2013. And, uh, it was, to me, it first fascinated as a technology solution to. Very particular computer science problem called the Byzantine General's problem. But all you need to understand is what they'd solve is a way of getting a bunch of people who don't know each other and don't trust each other to still agree on something.

And this is a much harder problem than it may sound like it is the nature of the current generation of technology. That it is a highly centralized. We have replaced geographic oligopolies with global monopolies. That trend line is very worrying because that's not the internet. I think we were all promised.

We were promised a decentralized internet where we kind of all collectively control outcomes, but like in any system you have to have rules. You have to have consensus. You have to have ways of rewarding people who contribute to the network. You have to wait. Punishing cheaters who harmed the network and, and blockchains use mathematics, cryptography, peer to peer networking to create digital consensus and allow truly leaderless digital networks.

And I think that is what is compelling about them. Yeah. So fame is a curse. I don't recommend it for anybody. Uh, you want to be, you want to, uh, you know, this is a globe, but you want to be rich and anonymous, not poor and famous, uh, cause like this is a disease of social media. Is getting there five seconds of fame and becoming a celebrity and celebrities are the most miserable people in the world.

So it's not necessarily a good thing to go for it. It's the nature of the technology business that 99 out of a hundred startups effectively fail, um, because the winners are so outsized and so rare. So most entrepreneurs walking around know that they don't have product market fit, live in mortal terror of it.

They're not allowed to talk about it and everyone has to pretend they're winning and crushing it all the time. Uh, and, and this is highly stressful. So I just decided. Five or six years ago that I was done being miserable and I was going to be happy. Uh, you know, and, uh, I know this sounds easy in hindsight, but it was sort of like, well, this entire time, I've just assumed that, uh, happy people aren't successful and if I'm going to be successful, then I can't be happy.

I have to be miserable. If I'm going to make a difference in the world, I have to be unhappy along the way. And I just sort of shifted my mind. And decided actually I'm at a time it's now or never there's no future to live for. And if I don't figure out how to be happy, I'm going to die unhappy. So tokens kind of can help bootstrap networks and solve the cold start problem that networks suffer from.

But now in the regulatory environment, we're in, these are all considered securities. So under securities law, I can't just distribute it. A wifi coin or an Uber coin, because I have to worry about, did I comply with securities laws and my ripping you off? Are you speculating? And there's such onerous restrictions that it basically just kills the whole thing.

One example that I think a forward-looking regulator could do is they could say, okay, when things have a dual use. Case like a utility token and a security token, we will err, on the side of letting it be used for utility early on. Uh, we're going to work with a company is to have a clear regulatory framework.

Uh, and then you could see a whole bunch of companies that want to experiment with utility tokens basing out of here, uh, and bootstrapping larger networks that could then eventually go on and compete globally because it is a nature of these things to be winner-take-all today. There is no government that has put its weight behind any cryptocurrency.

Whichever cryptocurrency gets a legitimate government, putting their weight behind it first will win the crypto wars. Winning the crypto wars is worth a minimum of $10 trillion is the value of gold, not even counting all the other use cases. And so if you're willing to be the first one out there, put your neck out there and bet on it.

Your people benefit. You're essentially the founding shareholders of that thing. The key observation here is a lot of crypto is just norms. It's like, we're trying to establish, do you drive on the left side of the road or the right side of the road? Uh, you know, do you speak English or do you speak Maori or do you speak Japanese?

Right. We're trying to decide on norms, but these are financial needs. So, if you are the one who establishes the financial norms for the world, then you have the benefit, the financial benefit of those stored assets. If you want to make good venture investment, you want to be non-consensus. Right. If you make a wrong investment, you lost your money.

You make a right investment. You can make money, but if it's conventional wisdom, if it's consensus, then it's heavily competed. The prices are a bit up. You're not going to make that much money. So you get paid for being non-consensus right. And non-consensus, especially in a technology context, it means. So you take risks, at least in the technology business, like whatever the geeks are doing on in their garage on weekends is what, like the entire world will be doing 20 years later as a mainstream thing.

So you sort of have to have a culture of tinkering, uh, experimentation, uh, following intellectual curiosity. You're not going to figure that out unless you. People who are obsessive tinkerers. You ha you have to be kind of obsessive about weird things. Uh, the good founders tend to be strange. Uh, the good, the good businesses all look strange at first.

Uh, it's only in hindsight that they become accepted asset classes as an individual. Uh, if all you do is trend chase, you will go insane, right? Like, oh, AI is hot. I better go brush up in AI. Or by the time you get good at AI, it'll have moved down to autonomous vehicles. Um, so I think you're much better off following.

Genuine intellectual curiosity rather than chasing whatever is hot right now, the equivalent for a nation is whatever it is that you're naturally good at doing and have both geographic and cultural and educational advantages in doing which somehow aligns on the world stage here. I'm reminding myself.

There's a few things in life that I care about. And there's a few things in life that any of us can like truly passionately, deeply care about things that we want to change and affect. And you kind of want to focus on those and not get distracted by caring about everything that comes along because we're evolved live in tribes of 150 people.

Uh, we're not meant to have all of the world's breaking news and emergencies packaged up into click-bait news attach with graphic images and videos and delivered to us with your phone buzzing in your phone. And while I'm saying this, my phone is buzzing in my pocket. You can't help people while you're drowning.

I mean, one of the problems I have with the modern environmental movement is it isn't, it is a culture of pessimism, uh, and that does not appeal to people. It's, it's a culture of fear and I would rather appeal to people through greed and optimism, you know, which people respond to. I just think that you have, you really have to be.

Uh, and not in a reactive way, not in a, I must be indifferent just, but just by realizing that if you take on all the world's problems, it will destroy you. In some ways we are desensitized to the horrors, and then we are constantly being over sensitized with just this wave of news, just constantly coming in.

Uh, and you have to be okay with saying to people like I've gotten myself. I'm working on it. I'm solving that problem. You've got yours. Fantastic. I'm glad you're solving your problem, but I can't take on all the world's problems. Otherwise I become a problem. You could even argue like that. Some of the things that are making a difference in the consciousness movement, everything.

Uh, so-called plant medicines to yoga. These are ancient technologies that are just becoming more prolific. They're becoming more widespread. Uh, but they're becoming more widespread as a consequence of technology. Uh it's it feels like everyone is Silicon valley is going to Peru for mysterious reasons recently.

Um, you know, but that's facilitated by a technology called airplanes and other technology called the internet. So these are, these are tools, another extreme example. Uh, you know, in Roman times, one of the ways that you kept the masses from fighting each other all the time was you had bread and circuses, right?

Very famously. You gave him some bread. You give him some entertainment, they're busy. Keep him out of trouble. Modern society. We're very enlightened. We don't have to, we're not going to be fooled by such things. So we have cannabis in video games and Netflix, right. Which are the advanced technological versions.

So there's a way of getting sucked into competition by looking around you. And the way to escape competition is through authenticity because no one can compete with you on being you. No one can compete with your business and doing what it uniquely does. Yes. Competition is a real thing. It does exist.

I'm not saying it doesn't exist, but it actually exists. In fake human made. Like sports and politics, where for one person to be above another person has to be below, right? Those are status games. You do not want to compete. You want to be a market of one. That's why like, uh, older individuals, society tend to be really impressed by how many people are working for you and people who are a little more savvy.

How much money are you managing or what kind of revenue are you doing? But really the correct question is how many robots are working for you? How many programmers are working for you? How many machines are working for you? Because those are the ultimate force multiplier. Really? I think we need to have a culture of adult education.

Uh, what if we had a model where every four years. You were expected and it was socially and culturally acceptable. And there was a financial support that you would go to school for a year. App store is the critical access point into the entire technology ecosystem. Uh, and the fact that that's owned by private companies means that all of the means of leverage.

Now, this is where Karl Marx would have a field day. Karl Marx today would not be attacked. Uh, the people who own the money or the machines, they be attacking the people who own the gateways to the app stores, uh, because that's where the means of production are really, uh, really gated busy is the death of productivity.

Uh, and, and people will spend a lot of time, uh, responding inbound to meeting requests and, uh, notifications, uh, and squander all of their time and energy. Uh, whereas if you want to accomplish anything in life, it gets done through phone. Uh, intent and focused action at some level, I do firmly believe that everything I've done in life is useless.

Uh, you know, it's not going to bring me any lasting satisfaction or peace and it doesn't follow me to the grave. So it's kind of pointless. Uh, so if I'm going to do it, do it for the art of it, do it because you enjoy it, do it for its own sake. Do it for self-expression in terms of fundraising for technology companies here and startups, uh, it's difficult because you're not in a technology hub and, uh, Funding markets actually develop backwards.

People think like, oh, I'm going to have angel investors and then series a and series B. But that's not how the market develops the way the market develops is some company bootstraps, a suite or an IPO creates a whole bunch of millionaire angels. Uh, then those angels, the smart ones actually don't invest in seed stage companies.

They actually invest in companies that are about to go. And then those ones, then they form little firms and invest in the ones that are just step before that step, before that. So you did risk all the way back down to seed level. There are a few of these kinds of places forming, uh, and I don't see why Wellington can't be one of those.

Right? I think it just, uh, it takes a little bit of focus and effort, but I think Wellington is well within striking range of being a great place to build a startup. And you just funnel the money in from Silicon.
