Stable. Welcome to vol. Thank you. Thanks for having me. I guess there were a lot of pioneers and influencers. So here I am.

No, no, no, no, no. I literally was telling my Lyft driver. I was like, this is the most important interview I'm I'm going to do. Um, no, no, no, no. For this podcast, please, don't be self deprecating. Everybody knows that you, I mean, everybody's following you on Twitter. Everybody's re-tweeting your tweets. Um, so let's chat about what you're up to.

Uh, last time you emailed me, me, it was to see you were no longer CEO of Angeles in the, we hadn't been for a while. But in July, I interviewed you and I think he said you were, um, but the title, no, I'm not big, big on titles. I have been, I started into a seven years ago. I've been running it in some form or another.

Um, for those seven years today, I'm executive chairman. I have a couple of good, uh, CEOs with different units. Cause Angeles has a bunch of different business units, uh, running it. So, uh, I'm still day-to-day here at the office and I still kind of do my thing. I just don't have that many direct reports anymore, which is a relief to me after seven years.

That's all it is. So what percentage of your time do you spend here versus with Metta stable physically I'm at Angeles the whole time medicine will doesn't even have an office. Okay. But I mean, just your, your time, what your, and with, uh, it, it varies some weeks it's 50, 50, some weeks are 70, 30 Angeles. Uh, you know, I met a stable, honestly, my partner, Lucas, Ryan and Josh Simon do a lot of the heavy lifting.

I'm just the face. So I do a lot of the time. Okay. Okay. So you're not, it's not like you've made some wholesale shift over to crypto. I would say my mind share is heavily crypto. So even on angel list, I spent most of this year building CoinList, uh, which is our legal regulated well-lit marketplace for ICO's that we started with protocol labs and we spun that out as a separate entity, but I was basically playing the founder role on that.

Um, so I helped assemble the company race, uh, you know, raising some money, um, just kind of create the whole infrastructure for it, get some of the early customers and they recruited a team for it really capable team, uh, and then handed it off. Okay. And I know that CoinList also recently. Launched a sister company Republic, crypto.

The Republic's been around for a while. So Republic is, uh, an evangelist, uh, crowdfunding spin out. So basically we had a bunch of Angeles alumni who left a few years ago and they started a crowdfunding company around title three of the jobs act. And that was Republic. And recently, as you've seen a lot of ICO's, they want to be legal.

They want to be compliant with securities laws. Uh, and so they are doing that, uh, using CoinList, but that only allows it to sell to accredited investors. They also want to be able to bring a one the rest of the community because community building is critical with, uh, with the coins and tokens. Uh, and so Republic is a crowdfunding site that is legal.

And so Republic crypto is this crypto arm that helps these ICOs also reach sort of more ordinary. Yeah. But with regulations and controls around how much they can invest in the levels of disclosure and sophistication that that's required. So, yeah, so the Angeles family has gotten pretty big. Now we have coin lists, we have Republic, we have product hunt, we have Angeles talent and of course we have Angela's fundraising.

So at this point it looks more like an alphabet, you know, like a group of like a group of companies rather than a single company. And so I'm executive chairman of that group. Okay. And for Republic, W would the ICS on that platform be limited to like 1 million or some small amount? Um, I, I think the base case, the easiest case is 1 million, which is what's in there by law, but Republic could also do things like reggae plus offerings and other offerings that can open it up to more investors.

It's just that the disclosure of the diligence, the preparation, all that work goes up. So it just depends on how much you're trying to raise what the specific circumstances of your company are. Unfortunately, when it comes to securities law, I think it's simple. I can't summarize it on a podcast, but if you're interested, uh, if any listener is interested, they should reach out to the Republic team or to the coin this team.

Okay. So I want to establish everything that you're doing across crypto. I kind of did a little bit of digging you're on the board of the Zcash foundation. You back to crypto index fund, the holes 10, which I wrote about, I will put that in the show notes guys. Holton? Yeah. Bitwise. Yeah. Is the name of the company hold tenders.

Uh, I've been pushing him to call it the huddle. Tim, that's been a big hurdle,

I guess they wanted to be conservative. I think they want to go very mainstream. Right? The whole point of an index fund is making a, a low cost vehicle available to lots of people. So to the average, Joe, who may not know what huddle is, they might think it's a whole misspelling. That is true, which it is, which it is.

Exactly. Yeah. Um, so obviously you're also doing CoinList Republic crypto, um, and you've also invested in file coin Blockstack. Uh, Ryan and Minnie were actually in the podcast, a few episodes back for listeners who want to learn about them. You invest in base coin, which is attempting to do a stable coin.

Did you, he invested in Numerai a tiny bit and knew Mariah way back when ledger X tiny bit way back when chia coin cracking Corbett. Um, there's about three more cooking right now that haven't been in enough. Um, but I actually don't do a whole lot in, in the private side of crypto. Um, most of my crypto investing, uh, certainly all the public coins, you know, the Bitcoins, the Ethereums, and those things all go through Mehta, stable, um, and even the private investments, a lot of them go through meadow stable.

I only do it personally on top of Metta stable. Um, if I want to put it more basically. So is there any particular philosophy or thesis that you're following as you make these choices about what to get involved? Yeah, at least at the mall, I definitely have a distinct point of view, uh, which is that, uh, for the most part, I'm looking at the money and money, like tokens, uh, the things that can become a store of value, unit of account, uh, medium of exchange or B, uh, power or power financial contracts.

Uh, and I make that trust because I think those are the most near term applications that are close to being fulfilled by, by close. I mean, five to 10 years, I don't mean two years. Uh, and, uh, those are also the applications. Uh, that are the largest markets, frankly, if you get to redefine what money is, that is a much larger generational shift of value, um, than building an app application.

Uh, the exceptions I make, I do make an exception of certain apps that I think can be really large. They fall quite as an example where file storage is, is a big thing. But none of this is investment advice. You should not invest in any of this. Like my, my advice to people would be if they want to invest in this asset class, it's crazy risky just by a tiny amount in an index fund and be done with it.

That's the best thing you can do. Um, obviously, uh, th this, this asset class makes venture look like safe bonds and, you know, value equities. So, um, anyway, so, so going back to that, uh, I invest in the money and money, like tokens to take the large or things that I think can be platforms. That's why I'm in Blockstack.

That's why I'm in five-point because I think they can be large platforms. Um, and I'm also an investor in mesh, which, uh, I just like what they're doing. Um, so it's an orchid, orchid, orchid. Uh, they used to be based, we call it something else, but, uh, orchid, which is, uh, doing some kind of, uh, uh, tours slash incentivize VPN, uh, for the world, just because I think that.

Real uncensorable VPNs or something. The world needs, especially in a lot of countries. Uh, it's something that, uh, crypto is uniquely well suited for because they're, they need to be decentralized by nature and even resistant to attacks by nation states. Um, so I think that's a good thing for humanity and just needs to.

Yeah, well, I was reading your blog and you basically dreamed that up in 2014. And I wondered if Steve Waterhouse is the founder of orchid. If he's still that from you, or if you gave him the idea or what happened there? Well, in 20 14, 20 13, uh, I got bitten by the Bitcoin bug and the virus, the virus took hold.

And I couldn't think of anything other than this new model for how to create and deploy protocols and how to kind of administer and control the large networks. Um, so on my blog, which is startup boy.com, I wrote a few articles where I had some ideas about how else this could be used. Uh, and I missed some use cases and I picked out some good use cases and they're sort of the obvious ones.

And there were some that I put in there that still haven't come true. Like, uh, we need a very fast clearing, low transaction fee coin, uh, that can be used for, uh, settlements. A fast, moving anonymous, real world objects, like cars, negotiating rights away, for example. So some of these don't even exist yet, but I tried to get fanciful and it's the nature of features and we're going to get a few.

Right. Uh, and then you take credit for everything that comes after it and you get a few completely wrong and you sweep those under the road, but it's all out there in the open. I put it down in writing. So it keeps me intellectually honest. Yeah. And honestly, I mean, you know, I get pitched so many things, but when I got the orchid pitch, I was like, oh, this, this is interesting.

Um, unfortunately I didn't get to write about it, but it's the nature of covering this space where there's 5 million things going on all the time. Um, so I'm kind of curious because you have this sort of long history in startups and in Silicon valley and things are shifting right now. So I'm going to do a brief summary of your career.

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong in any of this. But you know, earlier you launched your opinions and according to the San Jose, mercury news, your VCs, and one of the co-founders convinced you and some of the other co-founders that the company was worthless, they entered. A merger and rebrand that went public was later acquired by eBay for $600 million.

And you, and those co-founders who felt that you had been sort of duped sued and later settled. And then that experience led you to become an expert in term sheet negotiation, which then led you to be com a matchmaker, basically for startups and investors, which led to angel angel list. And obviously, you know, angel list has been hugely successful.

Um, but here we see, but maybe you tell me if you agree with this, that the startup model is getting up ended. And, um, here it is now you're, you're, you've joined this firm, this, uh, crypto hedge fund that is not even investing in startups at all, but mostly in decentralized. No. So I'm sort of interested to hear how you think this model of like VC backed startups that eventually go public has evolved over time, how you would describe the current phase of where we're at and in that, yeah, it's changed a lot for sure.

With Angeles, we tried to create a network to bring a lot of the startup deals online, get them access to more investors, get more investors around the world, access to startups. And that's, that's the work relatively well today? I'd say about a quarter of the deals in the English speaking world. Um, mostly, uh, California, New York, uh, and, uh, Europe and Australia are available on Angeles to a savvy investor.

Um, also about half the companies, startup companies and English speaking world are recruiting on AngelList and there's about a million candidates available on there. So we've definitely had a big impact, but the real financial financing shift for startups that's happened as I see. And there we created a new native token model needed to the internet, native to startups that helps them get funded online.

It's still in very early phases. So it's frothy, it's full of fraud. It's full of junk. Um, so it's not something that every startup can or should use. It's really designed for a small class of internet protocols, uh, that I think are being developed today that could not have been developed 20 years ago, that the first generation of internet protocols, the HTTPS TCP IPS of the world, uh, these are free open systems where nobody got paid for them.

They basically treat every resource in the protocol as too cheap to meter. But I think now entering an age where these, we have a next generation of internet protocols that are starting to meet are scarce objects, digital scarcity, and that could be money. Money is a digital object, but it's scarce.

Obviously you don't wanna be able to just create it as you go. Uh, bandwidth is another one file storage, maybe another one, um, mid, although that's debatable, uh, may turn out that, uh, Energy is another one, uh, et cetera. So whenever you have digital scarcity, blockchains are creating a new generation of internet protocols.

They come bundled with these tokens, which is how you keep track of who owes, who, what, in this scarce environment, uh, the tokens themselves and create a financing mechanism. Uh, because there are bare assets where owning the token is all you need. You don't need to register with the company or file with the sec.

Um, they can be more freely traded all around the world. They get treated like cash or money like instruments. And so startups have sort of created their own new financing mechanism. That's native to the internet and that can upend parts of VC and where it's happening is at the edges. So if you look today that, you know, Uh, sorry, let's go back like 10, 15 years ago.

If you want to raise VC financing, you went to Sandhill road, uh, or you went to a few firms in New York or Boston, your classic series, a series B series C series D. And maybe there was a little bit of angel investing right at the beginning. Uh, and then you rode this whole wave down until you got to go IPO 10 years later.

Um, well now the problem is the IPO markets have closed post post Enron. They're much tighter, much harder to go public. Um, so people are starved for liquidity and on the other side, seed investors, angel investors, angel lists, syndicates, micro funds. All of this has come up. So you have a lot of seed money floating around a lot more options there.

You also have things like Y Combinator and all the incubators you have, uh, um, Now you have safes for tokens, but you also have safes for easy, uh, easy legal documents. So the early stage has gotten very rich, very vibrant, very innovative. The very late stage has just been completely closed and the VC model in the middle hasn't changed.

So what's happening now is the early stage is creeping up. As a seed funds are raising more and more money and the seed rounds are getting larger. Uh, I was involved with a company that just closed a $4 million seed round on a safe note, which is an absurd concept. You know, three years ago, you couldn't have done that let alone 10 years ago.

Uh, and then on the other side, the ICO's are letting our opening the liquidity valve and taking the place of some of what the IPO is used to do. And VCs are getting squeezed in the middle. So now, if you're a venture capitalist, you either have to participate in a seed round for one of these companies or the AE, or you miss it because the next round is the ICO.

There's no series B or series C. Now, obviously I'm only talking for a very small class of companies. These are again the protocol token companies, uh, but people are definitely trying to expand the definition of what a protocol token company is and who should be using tokens. So I think the VC model really is in danger of getting squeezed down to a very, very small.

Which is sort of exciting, honestly, in a certain way, although I'm sure, you know, the VCs have developed norms over the decades that prevent them from getting squeezed, uh, or getting defrauded. Uh, although one could argue that there was a period of time when that power was used against entrepreneurs because they got too good at it.

Um, so now the pendulum is swinging in the other direction where an entrepreneur is far more likely to defraud a VC than the other way around. Uh, so it's, uh, so I think that the, in the new model, ICO investors, seed investors, they need to learn some of the same norms and practices and defenses that, that sort of helped balance the market out, uh, you know, in a.

Uh, biology terms, there is a predator prey relationship, right? But we, in these, these two characteristics, although there's an arm, basically an evolutionary arms race, right? Every time the entrepreneur is a new instrument, the VCs need to evolve to make sure they don't get taken advantage of and vice versa.

And historically the entrepreneurs were always at a huge disadvantage because the VCs do thousands of deals and they stick around for a long time. The entrepreneur shows up signs are for interpreter first term sheet, and they don't know what they're doing, but now the internet is leveling that great playing field.

Um, with the internet people exchange information, incubators level, the playing field, uh, Y C level the playing field, a lot Angeles levels of playing. Yeah. But one thing that I'm wondering is, um, in a way it is disruptive. And yet at the same time, I feel like a lot of the people that are able to invest in these ICO's are people like VCs, people who have money, um, particularly, you know, something like CoinList that does restricted to accredited investor.

So is it really that disruptive even with CoinList restriction? And I would guess 90% plus of the capital is coming from non-meat. Well, okay. Yeah, but I mean, let's just talk about disruption in terms of like who, who has money and who is able to get in on these deals? Well, there's this. Okay. So let's, let's talk about it.

In two, two forms. One is new players. I would argue 90% plus the money is coming from new players. Second is on the terms. The terms is coming on is very company friendly. So now the company can put hundreds of investors into around, whereas before they would've had one lead VC and a few angels, and the third is actually when the company's blockchains go lie and the tokens turn into a real use case with being used for real network, then retail investors can go in on these secondary exchanges, like a Coinbase or a Gemini or a crack in a, and they can buy stuff there too.

So it is opening up. I'm not saying it's perfect. It's not going to happen overnight. Um, also as we can see, like, you know, when we've opened up the market from just VCs to ICO's, the valuations, the pricing has literally increased 10 X has gone insane. So it's not clear you want to increase it that much, that fast, uh, while the norms aren't in place, because you have companies that probably couldn't raise 5 million bucks through the venture circuit that have suddenly raising 50 million ICLs and that's not a good thing.

Um, so, so the market needs to settle out. There needs to be a little bit of a crash. It needs to be a little bit of a come up and it's versa for some of these, uh, investments. And then I think it'll become more rational. It's the nature of technology that there's always a new Zuber. It's, there's always a bubble.

There's always a crash. And we just have to go through that cycle here. And can you imagine right now, any mechanisms that would sort of both help keep the democratizing aspect as well as, um, sort of rein in some of these wild valuations for singing? I think there's needs to be a market correction for.

Uh, so, you know, a lot of the poor poorly thought through projects, the need are going to fail the ship product, or they're going to ship product, and it's not gonna amount to anything, or people are gonna figure out that, oh, the decentralized version of this is an even worse idea. The centralized version was so central aspiration didn't work.

Why is it decentralized? Interesting. So the people will figure that out. The investors will sell those tokens. The market will crash. There'll be the inevitable crash. For the government to step in and do something. And I think that's the critical time period. If the government doesn't step in and do something, I think it's actually a little better, uh, because then the market will correct and we'll learn, uh, if the government does step in and do something, you know, something quote-unquote, then you get another set of rules and you're playing a hundred years from now that no longer apply.

Meanwhile, most of the capital formation flees overseas. So I think it, it depends there's, there's probably a happy medium, but the medium, yeah, isn't in the middle. It's probably more in the favor of just letting the market play out and correct itself out to some extent, when you, when you look at early investors in Bitcoin and Ethereum, they've collectively made over a hundred billion dollars, uh, and to them, that's almost, you know, returns on investment.

So it's, it's, uh, money that they came in and they sort of created out of thin air. So to them spending. I mean, name, name, any of the other hundreds of altcoins? You know what I mean? Like it's easy to say it for those. Yeah. I, I, I sincerely hope that anyone who's buying, uh, especially the alt coins is doing it with an extremely small percentage than that word.

So they won't lose sleep at night. If it goes away, anyone who's putting in a meaningful amount could be in for a really rude surprise at the end of the day in an open market, you can't protect everybody. The price of protecting is basically killing the market and turning it back into a crony capitalist system or turning into a highly restricted system.

So you can't have it both ways. You can't have it open and democratize while at the same time having, you know, nannying and babysitting. So you gotta think what people want. Yeah. And I do feel like there must be some way to combine the two and you know, to, to do both. I, I don't know if we that's, the that's the middle of the STC tries to walk, uh, but at the end, but this one is tougher because these are global.

So even if you stop a us citizen, you say, Hey, you can't trade this token. Um, they can just go anonymously and do it somewhere overseas. Is it purely digital assets? Uh, and I think one important thing to realize here is that we've always had strong financial regulations, but we have no speech regulation speeches free, um, because we're a free society and we're not going to do away with free speech because it's the fundamental basis for a free society.

Uh, but now money is just code and code. It's just speech. So money and speech are actually the same thing. So you're trying to keep speeches free and you're trying to restrict the flow of money. And the two of those just can't go together. And what do you mean by that? When you say like, money is, is a form of speech, I don't really know what that means.

So in this case, what Bitcoin did, was it turned code into my right. It's a bit quite pure code. There's no paper, there's no guns. There's no federal government. It's just pure code. So just start Bitcoin, you got to stop. And code is actually just speech. It's just a bunch of numbers and letters that are right down that are computer interprets.

So you have to stop me from writing those numbers or letters down in a certain sequence and conveying them to other people to stop them from loading it on a computer, somewhere in the world to stop that somebody else will then turning that into money. So you can't control the way money flows until unless you can stop the developers from writing the code and from talking to each other and from thinking, and, uh, the regime that could do that would probably be one of the most evil regimes on the planet.

Um, not a society that I think any of us would want to live in. So essentially by turning money into, sorry, by turning speech into code or just writing into code, uh, that computers can interpret and then turning code into money that computers can exchange you can't stop money from moving around anymore.

Huh? This is what China's figuring out. This is why they had to shut down all the exchanges because, uh, they had huge capital flight. Because they're trying to control the egress and ingress and egress of money in China. Um, but you can't do that unless your firewall policy can filter out all the traffic that has to, that looks like money.

And it's really hard to recognize what it is, cause this is all encrypted to begin with. So there's all these zeros and ones floating by on the wire. You're trying to figure out which one is someone talking in we-chat and which one is money? Really hard? Probably. So, yeah, that's one thing. I mean, obviously, I mean, there are so many theories about like why China did the correct and then it did, um, the obviously capital flight is one.

Um, other people are seeing that they want to do their own cryptocurrency. Um, but I think one thing that I've looked into and that confuses me still is I just wonder why they have shut down in the Bitcoin mining. Do you have a theory about that? I have not have not. Well, Bitcoin mining. The miners are a very small set of people who are very well known to the government.

So if they're concerned about capital flight, they can literally just watch those few actors. Um, whereas if there's general trading going on in the exchanges, uh, and it's very frothy, um, then you, you have to basically monitor the exchanges. Of course, I think it's extremely heavy handed. They shut down the exchanges.

I think it'll backfire because what's going to happen is sites like local Bitcoins and crypto crypto exchanges are gonna capture the, just the, the access. And it's going to go offline where they won't be able to track it. My sense is it was, it's just a pure guess I have no insider information, but my sense of it was done for capital flight reasons.

And with the miners, you can just track the capital flight. So it's much easier to control. I think in the medium term, they do know they have to re enable it. They have to re enable it because this is very much the future of internet protocols and they can't miss out on the next generation of protocols.

This is also the beginning of digital commodities. And when it came to physical commodities, they went out there and tried to accumulate as many of them as possible. So this should be no different, uh, and this, so I think it's more likely that they nationalize the miners, then the shut down the miners.

Wow. Interesting. Okay. We're getting a little bit, um, further away from where I wanted to go, but I actually just wanted to go back to, um, the, this tension about like protecting investors. Um, but also, you know, letting innovation go, I. You know, know that you were involved in getting the jobs act passed. Um, those are the crowdfunding rules that enabled everyday people to invest in startups.

It's less well-known jobs act really enabled ICO's in one critical way before the jobs act, it was completely illegal to solicit the public, uh, publicly for investment, even to accredit it. You literally could only go through words of mouth and close networks like AngelList or YC. Um, you could not, for example, uh, you know, announced in a press release that you're raising money, even from a credit it's and the jobs act title two of the jobs act allowed something called general solicitation.

Um, and that seemed like it was going to be a big deal, but it wasn't. So in 2013, when that was announced, we had angel this enabled general solicitation, a lot of fanfare around it. Nobody used it. So we thought it was dead on arrival until the ICLs showed up. And the ICO's. Okay. Okay. And then the title three of the jobs act enables crowdfunding, which is what I think you're referring to where small dollar investors can invest in a early stage company.

Well, so one thing that I found a little bit curious when I was just thinking my in history was, you know, you worked on this funding mechanism that would open up investment to the crowd, but then with the ICO is one of the first things he did was pointless, which is, you know, for wealthy investors. And I just wondered, well CoinList plus Republic together can hit the whole market.

Um, so you have, because of the way the regulations are written, unfortunately the current law assumes that if you have a million dollar net worth, you're a genius. And if you have lower than a million dollars, you're a fool. So you fall into two completely different regulatory frameworks. Um, so we have to have two different entities, but between those two entities, you can do a full ICO to accredited and non-accredited, that's the light I'll make it up.

I don't, I don't think it's necessarily rational and reasonable. If it were up to me, it would be more of a sophistication. Uh, and it would be a smooth gradient rather than a binary cutoff between a 1 million above and below. Uh, but that's just the way the law is. Right. Well, I wonder if it actually, if you, because he were involved in lobbying for that and kind of helping to formulate that regulation.

So I wondered if you had any ideas about how they might do things better. Yeah. The, the current regulatory regulatory infrastructure is. Just a giant mess of individual regulations that have been piled on since the 1930s acts over the last 80 something years. And it's the infrastructure wall street runs on, which is the most powerful lobby in the world and doesn't want anything to change.

So just getting the jobs act through was a miracle, uh, because it really did seem to some elements on wall street. Like it was a threat. Uh, it was a bypass around their choke hold on capital formation and capital distribution. Um, so I wouldn't expect a lot of regulatory relief. Uh, I think what we can, what we can hope for is enforcement relief.

Uh, maybe a little bit of enlightened non regulation of crypto, just like there was not a regulation of the internet in the early days. So a little hands-off and then most importantly, global company. Because there are other countries in the world that don't own the reserve currency of the world, but don't have strong financial infrastructure.

They would like to be able to play in the next generation of financial infrastructure. So I think that will keep it. Yeah. That will help people keep each other honest. Okay. So you're not thinking about getting in the lobby and game again. God, now it's exhausting. I mean, I do a little bit behind the scenes here and you're like, there's this whole stock options thing in the Senate recently.

Um, so we weighed in on that. Um, I've definitely been talking to and help educating some people on Capitol hill about crypto and you know, what the kind of enlightened regulation there is. Uh, and, uh, we have responded to information requests from the sec and they're actually very up to speed. So, um, they're, they're quite knowledgeable about it, but they come in and they ask us for data.

Um, so I participate in all of that, but I'm not going to go out there and lobby Congress again. Okay. All right. Well, we're going to talk about what a blockchain future looks like and how it all assesses tokens. But first I'd like to take a quick break to tell you about our. Sponsor OnRamp. If you're starting up a new project or need some design or branding help on an existing one on ramp.

Patsy cupboard on ramp is a full service creative agency that has helped numerous companies, including many in the crypto space. Next to me as their brand awareness gain traction and accelerate growth. On-ramp has a passion for assisting brands in boosting business results and can help with everything from website and liquid design, to social and content strategy focused on your core technology and leave the rest to on-ramp to learn more and see how they've helped passionate entrepreneurs achieve their dreams.

Go to think on ramp.com. I'm speaking with navel romcom partner at meta stable and chairman of angel list. So let's look at how you evaluate tokens. Do you have any kind of step-by-step process when you get a pitch or hear about a token? Like what do you look for first? What do you look for next? What factors make you realize it's not worth researching?

Yeah, first, I sent it to my partner, Lucas, which is a little glib, but it's a way of telling you that even though I think I'm fairly sophisticated in this space, it's very, very difficult to evaluate if anything, um, Lucas and Josh, uh, actually in many cases when the code is available, along with the technologies available, there are a lot of the source code.

They'll review the buyers, their developers they'll track down their histories and really try and do a level of technical due diligence that I think is critical in this space. Even to an extent that it's not a venture in venture. If someone comes to you and says, you know, I'm a professor so-and-so and I've written this code on VR headgear, um, it's enough to use the application or use the prototype.

Uh, whereas here, I think you actually have to go and review the source code. It's just another level. And what are you looking for? Like what would be red flags in the code? Well, the number of people in the world who we're qualified to develop an internet protocol is probably numbers in the hundreds.

It's not. Hundreds of thousands. Uh, so you have to basically make sure that they know what they're doing in terms of distributed systems, engineering, encryption, protocol, design, photography, all that stuff. So you're looking for technical competence. You're looking for a good design. You're looking for having thought through all the various holes you're looking for experience.

And then, uh, there are, there are outright frauds in the space where the white papers look really good, but there are backdoors, right? So Lucas used to make a living, uh, beforehand by claiming bug bounties by finding holes in coins or bugs in coins. Um, so he also looks at, uh, those kinds of things. So for example, you know, we looked at the parody wallet stuff a while back, and Lucas concluded that it was just too dicey.

There was the code was just too complicated and they were trying to do too much. So he didn't identify a specific hole, but he said, this is the kind of thing that has holes. So we can't trust this. Um, so we have to be very conservative on the technology side, um, at a market level we look to see, is there a big, is there a big enough market for this?

Is this trying to be a money like token? Is it really bringing novel technology? Um, how has it priced? And you know, right now I'm probably getting hit with like 10 ICO deals a day. Uh, and nine out of the 10 are actually pretty easy to dismiss because very often they're just companies. Uh, don't need a token.

We're not interested in blockchains or cryptography until suddenly the ICO boom started, um, or their ideas that often didn't work as a centralized company. So why would they work with a decentralized? Um, so, and a lot of them don't need a token in the middle, or they don't need their particular token in the middle.

There'll be better off, uh, especially because all the winning cases here are open source software, somebody who's just going to fork them, remove their proprietary token and insert a Bitcoin or Ethereum, or maybe a version of proprietary token. That gives 0.1% of the developers instead of 10 or a hundred percent of the developers.

So I think a lot of it is just outright greed. Um, and so those ones are easier to dismiss. Then I think there's a category, uh, that are interesting, but probably too early where people are trying to build, you know, next generation, uh, marketplaces or. Uh, broad applications, almost platform like applications, but I think we're still at the infrastructure layer.

Um, so I tend to dismiss most of those. Uh, I don't, I think that might be fine and investments for other people, but I have a strong viewpoint that we're still in the infrastructure phase here. So I tend to remove a bunch of those. So that's sort of like choosing not to invest in web land, but later investing with an Instacart, something like that, something like that.

Hopefully that would be, that would be good if that works out. Um, there's also a number of these that are, uh, what, uh, considered asset tokens, where they're not really a protocol where you have some digital thing you're moving around underneath. It's actually rather than mapping some asset in the real world, like a piece of real estate or a car, uh, or a share in a real world company.

Uh, I also think those are less interesting. Uh, they're not, it's not fully digital, it's not fully protocol native. It requires external enforcement by law, uh, by legal authorities. Uh, and as such, it's basically a security by another name. Um, so, uh, those ones also less interested in, uh, intent to dismiss.

Uh, and then when you get into what I consider to be the protocol tokens, and especially the gold standard of the money, like protocol tokens, um, the bar there's really high, cause there's only going to be one to five winners and that entire. So the technology has to be money, has a variable, powerful network effect to it.

Uh, one way to look at it is, uh, you know, if we didn't have geographic national boundaries, we'd probably only have the us dollar or the equivalent for the entire world. We wouldn't have thousands of currencies. Um, the currencies only exist because of national borders. Money is like language. Uh, it's something that's intrinsic to the human species.

We want it to be as open as possible in the world tends towards one. Now within money itself, there are different use cases. There's store of value, like gold there's unit of account, like where we use dollars for today. And there's a medium of exchange where we actually currently. Uh, digital packets that represent us dollars or, or, uh, uh, signal digital signatures represent us dollars.

And the next money could be all three of those things. In one, it could be a different one for each of those three things, or it could be that we have a basket of things for each one, and it's not clear yet. Nobody really knows what it's going to be one or three or 20 or a hundred, but it's more likely going to be in the one to five, one to 10 range.

So now you're basically saying, okay, there's hundreds of still business plans to do these. There's only going to be one, maybe two winners. So you really, really have to have a very, very high technical bar, um, for what you think is going to do well. And today the default use case is the default case is probably going to be some combination of the top 20 cryptocurrencies.

So to get in there and unseen one of those, um, you're going to have to come up with a pretty fundamental innovation. And is that why you've invested in base point and Z cash? Like it, it sounds like maybe you think that a stable coin will definitely. Stable coin. Yeah. Stable coin is one of those coins that sort of needs to exist.

Um, I would honestly recommend a base coin. I think there's going to be dozens of players in this space of which none might win, but if one does win, then a stable coin is great because it allows you to actually do real world transactions without the price moving on you. One of the problems today, uh, as a user or as a merchant is Bitcoin and other coins are just too volatile.

When something can go up or down 10% in a day, uh, you can't use that to run your business. Uh, you have to get in and out of that as quickly as possible, uh, which encouraged transaction fees and historic costs and all those kinds of things, a stable coin in theory could hold its peg. Like the U S dollar stays within the very tight range, uh, over a long enough period of time that people can actually post prices in that coin.

And they can actually transact in that car. Well, one interesting thing that I thought when it was reading the base coin white paper was that, um, because I, you know, I understood this part about how they were sort of incentivizing. I forget the name of the. The group, um, cause there were like three people, there were the bond people and then there is actual coin.

And then there was the third where you're incentivized to, um, to sell your sister anyway, bond holders and that group. But the point is just that I was kind of like, well, their upside is only going to be limited to a certain percentage. So it was like, why would anybody speculate on this when they could speculate on like Bitcoin and ether and you know, and then I just wondered, like, is this going to be that popular?

Anyway, I just, because I feel like speculation is what's fueling everything right now. I was just was like, if somebody is being really rational, they're not gonna be like, oh, I'm going to get all in on this because they're going to realize that their profits are going to be pretty limited, so right. But they, but their downside is limited too.

And the profits may be relatively, not guaranteed, but maybe a lot more. Predictable. Um, so it's like, if you look in the bond market versus the stock market stocks on average, make a lot more money than bonds, but bonds are a quote-unquote safer and you're guaranteed your coupon over some period of time with very little risk of complete default.

Whereas equity, the chance of a total wipe out is actually pretty high. So equity ends up being more risk. Capital bonds tends to be more safe capital. And most of the money in the world goes into bonds, credit markets, not into equity markets. So you could argue the same kind of thing here, but a lot of it depends on the exact parameters and you're right.

That in the crypto markets it's driven mostly by extreme thrill-seeking money-making speculation. So it wouldn't be the same kind of investor that necessarily invested in both coins. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we'll see how well that one does. So one other thing is that I've seen in other interviews, you've talked about like with startups, about how timing is extremely important and a lot of that's due a luck.

So, um, I don't know if maybe referenced this a little bit earlier when we spoke, but do you have any particular types of tokens now that you think have a bigger chance of being lucky? Um, you know, like, are there any that you feel are kind of in that sweet spot? Really meeting, uh, or this space really needing them.

And then also the technology being pretty ready for them. Yeah. I think we're still in the infrastructure phase. Uh, even thing, even the two biggest coins, uh, Bitcoin and Ethereum have not yet figured out how to scale properly. They have not yet figured out how to decentralize properly. If theorem is still controlled by a very small number of developers, like very small, you can count them on one hand.

And Bitcoin is controlled by a relatively small number of developers, you know, probably like three dozen, uh, and a small number of miners who are concentrated heavily in China. Um, and a small number of exchanges that get to set policy on what do you call the coin? So we are not actually in the decentralized future yet.

And these, uh, platforms can't actually handle applications and scale them yet. Uh, that said we are making rapid progress. Um, so given that, I think that, uh, investing in apps, it's just early it's okay for entrepreneurs to start building them. And they're probably a few that may break out early. Um, like for example, you know, if you look at the first generation of.

Almost everything from the 1990s, 98, 99, nine.com. Bloom has gone. We don't use it today, but there are notable notable exceptions like Amazon and Google, right? The big five. So two of the big five companies were born during that time period. And apple was sort of reborn during that time period as an infrastructure provider to a lot of those companies.

Um, so I think you have to basically realize that the entrepreneurs are playing right now are playing an extremely high risk game. Uh, they may form the big five, but most of them are gonna end up like the.com companies, the pest.com and the web events. Um, so for me, at least as an investor, I look much more at the infrastructure and deployment phase.

So infrastructure phase, rather than the app development and the deployment phase, which will I think come later. And then earlier, when you were talking about how Bitcoin and Ethereum haven't really kind of figured out a good governance model for a decentralized network, do you have any particular idea in mind of how you think governance should work for these decentralized.

Well, they're, they're not really fully decentralized yet, but they're already more decentralized than anything that has come before them. Uh, and the thing that really makes it possible is that even though a theorem is only controlled by a small handful of developers, those developers can't just do whatever they want, uh, because the, uh, it's open source code.

It can fork very easily. If they do something unpopular, the users can literally pick up the code and the network and leave. Um, so that creates a level of honesty that that just doesn't exist. Imagine if you and I had the ability to press a button and teleport our entire lives from the United States to any other country that we have.

And that was true of any citizen of any country in the world. Um, countries would still have control over their geographic boundaries and their borders and the laws and the borders, but they would just behave extremely differently. Uh, it's also the difference being when you're casually dating somebody, versus when you're married to somebody, right.

When you're casually dating them, they have to be on their best behavior. Otherwise either party can walk out, but when you're married, then people kind of tend to revert to sort of not their worst selves, but their normal selves. Uh, and, uh, because they know they have lock-in. So at the end of the day, because cryptocurrencies can fork because the users can leave because of users can sell your parents to invite another one.

It just forces you to behave at a level that other that's not true with other code and other infrastructure. For example, there was a woman recently who was banned by Uber and Lyft because she went on some screed against them online. Um, and I'm sure, I think what she did was probably reprehensive. But the idea of being banned by Uber and Lyft, that's pretty insane because it's not like you really have a third option.

What are you going to do in San Francisco? Sit on the phone for 20 minutes and wait for a taxi. Um, so she, so those companies have a lot of control in crypto land. Nobody has that much control. They try to do anything that the community doesn't accept, the community's gone. Uh, and I think that right there, that right to exit creates better governance than almost any other system that we've ever had.

Now on top of that, you can layer on additional, better governance. Like Bitcoin has this concept of there's the users, there's a minder, there's it developers, right? It's a soft analogy that that would be visit judicial system. That's the executive system to this legislative system in the United States.

Um, so you do get some division of power, uh, but it can be better. Uh, Bitcoin's had a really hard time agreeing on anything new moving forward, which many people would argue is a source of strength because it's trying to be an immutable store of value. I actually think it's better for Bitcoin to be extremely conservative.

Uh, Bitcoin is where you put your money and hope that nobody can touch it. Nobody. Uh, that includes the government that includes the Chinese miners. That includes us developers. So if Bitcoin is going to make a mistake, I would rather than err on the side of not changing quickly enough, rather than changing too fast.

Because as a user now that may not be what's best for Bitcoin necessarily, but as a user, I have other options. I also have a theorem which changes a lot faster and moves fast and break things. But the other hand, because of that mentality, isn't really interested in protecting an investment. It's interested in creating an ecosystem of services on top.

And so, uh, that's probably where I'm more likely to want to run my business. Uh, and then something like Zcash and Monero are much more focused on privacy. And if I care about privacy, they're going to defend, protect and encoded at a level that the other big two are not. So I think in general, it's good to have.

Uh, diversity of coins with different governance models, different philosophies, different communities. And as a user, I can just go in and out of whichever one I need when I need it within a given community, they get extremely acrimonious and there's a lot of fighting mostly by the wholesalers because they just want to maximize value and survivability, and they have very different viewpoints on why that currency exists.

But as a user, I want there to be a thousand different currencies with a thousand different governance models and a thousand different et cetera, et cetera was. Um, so, uh, I think Bitcoin kind of is doing what Bitcoin does. And another video that you've done, you talked about how you thought back when the internet started, that it would be a democratizing force.

It would take out the middleman. Um, but now we've gotten like Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, Google, and you called them our new overlords. Um, do you think we've run again that risk of missing out on this democratizing opportunity that blockchain technology. Yeah, I was always, uh, I love the internet. I love computers.

I grew up on the internet and, uh, to me, the big promise of the internet was getting rid of. Uh, the chokehold that Microsoft and Intel had or the tech industry, or that other companies have over our lives. Um, the internet is fundamentally a democratizing force and we did do, was it got rid of a lot of choke holes, like, you know, the New York times, it was not what it used to be.

Um, it's Hollywood studios don't have the power that they used to have. Even the U S government kind of doesn't have the same power over, uh, certain things that it used to have. Uh, the banks don't have the same power that used to have the VCs don't have the same power they used to have. So it did help democratize certain things.

But it created these very thin, broad, new overlords that, uh, Ben Thompson from specie caused the aggregators. Um, but you know, you just look at the big five. You look at how concentrated power is in the hands of an Amazon or Google or Facebook or Twitter and Microsoft, Microsoft, uh, or even Uber. Uh, these countries, these companies essentially run natural monopolies, beneficial monopolies that help the consumer.

They're not jacking up prices on us. They're actually doing quite the opposite. What they're doing is they're lowering prices on us and they're squeezing suppliers on the backend, but we still end up going through one company and whatever its politics are, whatever its power structure is. That's what we're beholding like looking at Twitter at Twitter, it could be the greatest force for freedom in humanity.

You can have one person broadcast censorship free to the entire world, but Twitter doesn't run as a censorship free platform, nor is it available in certain countries. Um, if it were built on a blockchain, Twitter would be available in every country would be very hard to repress and you couldn't shut down any speech.

And I think something like that needs to exist. So the good news is I think blockchains with blockchains, the long arc of the internet is bending back towards decentralization. And I think we're actually going to have next generation of companies will be created. That will be far more decentralized and have much smaller chunk points than the current set do.

And so you really don't worry that we will end up just with neutral. You know, watching based overlords. I don't, because I think chains are inherently decentralized it's in their core infrastructure. You can't change it without ripping it out to give you an example. Uh, then they recently went off on this giant screed against the gab.

Gab is this Twitter like competitor that has a lot of, uh, you know, the right wingers that have been thrown off a Twitter on it. Uh, Gabs are looking for a new home to build where it won't get censored. Um, so gab wants to build on top of Ethereum and do an ICO, uh, and Vinay who was involved early on with the Ethereum foundation.

Ethereum development went off in this giant screed about how your cab, you are not allowed here. We will stop you. We don't want you or your people building on top of Ethereum. Uh, and you know, it's interesting to watch one of the, I don't know if he's a founder, but one of the early people in it. Sort of try so hard to stop something and basically have no effect, uh, Vitalik, the lead developer basically said, no, we're not going to stop anyone.

In fact, you go to the homepage for theorem. It says, build unstoppable applications. Even Vitalik couldn't even do it if he wanted to, because if you're in would basically just kick him out. The community, jumped all over, uh, Vinay and told them to get lost. They said, you don't speak for us. Uh, and I don't even think it's possible, even if all the developers and all, and a large chunk of the community wanted to stop them get, would just forget, like happened with Ethereum classic.

You don't build on top of Ethereum classic. So these really are unstoppable sort of networks. Uh, and it means that you can't have censorship and you can't have central control beyond the level that's encoded into the system. And if someone doesn't like the level of this code in the system, they can always fork it or they can go to hundreds of competing cryptocurrencies.

Well, so speaking of control, um, you also said in another video that blockchains make individuals sovereign and put them in power. Um, but I think the other thing that happens at that point is that then it gives peoples another thing to manage. And I just wonder, like, if I even think about managing my own private keys or my identity or whatever, it's just, it feels like another burden.

Another thing to worry about. Do you think people really do want to manage their own personal data? Uh, I think most people don't want to, but they want to have a choice of who manages it for them. So, uh, in today's model, but the way the world works is if I need a bank, it has to be one of the federal reserve, regulated member banks.

And there's just very little innovation or competition between them. Uh, if I have my identity, Experian, TransUnion and Equifax manage it, whether I like it or not. And we saw how well that worked out in the Experian hack. Um, so I just don't have any. Whereas in a blockchain based model, I can choose if I want to manage my own identity, I can, if I want to put it on civic or Blockstack or a different blockchain, I can, uh, if I want to have a third party that I trust that can be a thousand different third parties competing for the right to help me manage it.

And they can have different security models, different pricing, uh, different policies and how they issue identity data to various people and take responsibility for it. So what, at the end of the day, all of this boils down to not that this isn't necessarily better, but that it gives you freedom of choice across the board.

So freedom to. Centralized in a certain way. At least people are choosing that. Is that exactly like with Facebook? I don't really have a choice. I want to be in the same network as all my friends and family, I got to go on Facebook and only Facebook and operate that network only Facebook has access to that data of Facebook.

That's built in the blockchain. There'll be hundreds of thousands of companies, any one of which I could say, okay, you are the, you are my manager of my social network profile and data. Uh, the others aren't and you're misbehaving, or you're selling my data for ads. I'm switching away from you. So now you have reputations, you have choice.

I mean, look what separates capitalism from communism and its outcome is not a test. Uh, communism probably has better intentions. What separates them is choice in capitalism. I can choose my vendors. I can choose to leave. I am a consumer. And by having the choice, I'm in charge, whereas in communism, because I have no choice, I've become a vessel.

Uh, so the same thing happens in blockchain land versus classic internet land or classic financial infrastructure. Then classic, uh, model. I have no choice. There's one or two or three monopolists or federally appointed oligopolies who get to run my entire life. Whereas in a blockchain world, the data is on the blockchain.

It's ultimately controlled by me and I can cryptographically lock and unlock it for different entities based on how well they are serving me. And if they're not serving me well, I can always do it myself, worst case, or if I don't want to do that, I can lock them all out and choose the friendliest one of the line.

So in a way, it's like if you do use a centralized service with when it comes to the extent any of these blockchain based networks, Then, first of all, it's your choice. But then also there could be many more of them than there were before. And my data's portable and blockchains are one of the key differences between blockchain based protocols and the first generation of internet protocols.

Isn't a blockchain based protocol. It holds state, my data is held in the network. Uh, so I can take my data with me, whereas good luck exporting your data out of Facebook in such a way that if there was even a competitor that has survived, that a competitor could use it. Okay. So I want to go back to the governance question.

Do you have any particular model in mind of how you think decentralized networks should make decisions? The, the, the decision-making model for the decentralist blockchains come straight of the open source movement? So it's around commit access and consensus and drafts and requests and the ability, little fork, um, that's sort of the best model that we've found to date for these code based systems.

Um, the new constituencies that have been added are the users, uh, and. Investors, right. Uh, and of course minors. So those constituencies didn't exist in the open source movement. So minors, the way that they vote on governance is basically built into each protocol, um, the way the users vote and, uh, the way that the investors vote is investors vote by buying and selling the way their users vote is by adopting, not adopting.

All of these can be improved. So for example, you could see that future wallets would allow users to actually vote on the feature of their currency, through the wallet. So very much like you have, uh, elections, uh, you could have your wallet basically say, Hey, this month, these three currency that you hold are making decisions on these three things.

Um, here's what people that you trust in the community or follow on Twitter are saying, how do you want to vote? Um, you go have a voting mechanism built directly to the wallet. Um, you could imagine something similar for the miners and the software that they use. For investors, especially the ones who are speculating and buying into ICO's, you know, against all odds.

Uh, they actually need to have much stronger governance. They need to be able to say, well, you know what? Okay, we're putting 50 million to this crypto into this ICO project, but we're not going to just give you all 50 million pucks immediately. It gets locked up into a contract where it gets released in milestones, every 5 million bucks every three months.

And there's a vote based buy on the wallets on the different holders as to whether we release it to you or not based on that. Have you been hitting the milestones and have you been performing that's the simplest level, but you can imagine many, many more layers of governance. So I think we will get more sophisticated about these things over time, but it's going to take years to evolve.

Uh, and my fear is there'll be a boom bust cycle and then a crack down, which doesn't give it a chance to evolve, but that's the way it should work. Well, how much bigger do you think this. It can, it can go a lot bigger. I mean, the amount of money in the space is still small. the.com bubble was 1.7 trillion, and that was restricted just to United States.

And that was just accredited investors. So this one can, and there was 20 years ago. So you take all those factors into account. This one can go a lot. Bigger. Custody has been a big problem, this space. How do you hold on to your private keys as you were saying earlier? So I think that is starting to get solved.

I think within a year or two, a year and a half, you're going to see a lot of very serious solutions in the custody space. Uh, and at that point, you going to see a wall of money coming in from endowments and sovereign wealth funds and larger players. Even now, you know, at the beginning of this year, I only knew of two crypto hedge funds, polishing and medicine.

Uh, and even polishing, I think is only about a year old. Uh, and there were a couple that were sort of just in Bitcoin, like Pantera and grayscale and so on. Um, now there's probably a hundred. So the number of crypto hedge funds going through the roof. And I think that all these big boy hedge fund managers sitting in Connecticut or wherever their fanciest states are saying, wait a minute, you're making these returns, you're getting this money.

And you're an amateur. I'm going to enter this space too. So we're going to see a lot more of those people flooding in. So I think the amount of money that can flood in the market still is enormous. And so it sounds like you think that regulatory action will only really happen when there's some kind of correction.

I think the sec is already taking a regulatory action against the obvious frauds, but I think the way most money is lost in markets is not in fraud. It's actually just lost to poor investments. Legitimate people who are trying to legitimate things and just weren't very good, or they were at the wrong time or they didn't get very far.

Um, so that's how the majority of the money gets lost and I think that's going to happen. And there's nothing the sec can do about that. That's just the market needs to develop a taste and a nose for what a good investment is, and that takes time. And so let's talk about, uh, power and how this is disruptive to those empower.

What kind of threat or disruption do you think that this post is to governments? I think the most interesting thing about cryptocurrencies is if you step back for a second, The history of the human race is a history of networks. Uh, and humans are the winning species, uh, compared to other species because we have the ability to cooperate across genetic boundaries, right?

You're probably what Chinese by origin Korean. Okay. I'm uh, Indian by origin. My wife was actually Korean by origin. We can communicate, we can cooperate. We can relate. We can inter marry. Um, these are the kinds of things that other species just don't do. Uh, they literally only cooperate within genetic boundaries within the anti, within the beehive, within the very small tribe.

And humans can do this because we stitch together networks by telling you the stories and the story of networks is the history of the human race. The United States. Um, Forbes and network, uh, angel list as a network, the U S dollars in network, the English language is in network. Uh, so we create these networks and generally you have to have some way, especially in networks that are allocating scarce, resources of adjudicating and running.

And historically the oldest form of government that did that was you had a king in power who was basically whoever the most brutal person was the biggest tyrant. They got to be in charge. Um, or eventually the king got attacked by the mini Kings, the aristocracy, and they then forced them to share power.

So you also networks that are run by elites like the, uh, the medical system or the legal system, or even the us kind of the U S Republic is run more by elites than it is by a president or dictator. Um, you also can run a network by putting a corporation in charge and the corporation can punish cheaters like Uber writers, who aren't paying or who keep calling cards and canceling them.

Um, but then the corporation can end up as a monopolist, just like the kink and end up as a tyrant or the elites can end up as an aristocracy. You can also have a one person, one vote, a democratic or a communist network, but then you end up with a tragedy of the commons or. Um, so humans have always been trying to figure out how to govern large groups of humans, punish cheaters and reward the people who are contributing, uh, and the best network that we've created in the last few hundred years to do this kind of thing in our markets.

So markets are open, like, uh, democracies are commons. They allow anybody to participate, but you have to vote with money. So there's at least some merit based system, but it's a money merit based system. Blockchains extend that concept of market into managing all kinds of networks that before would've needed a central corporation or a central individual in charge.

And I think that's incredibly interesting and a blockchain based network, I can get rewarded for contributing whatever the network needs. So if it's a network that's allocating bandwidth to people. If I create an allocate bandwidth into the system, as a miner, I get rewarded by coin from that network.

And nobody's in charge. There's no central authority who then takes charge of the whole thing, takes a 50% tax and starts kicking out people that they don't like. So I think humans have literally created a new form of govern. It is a sixth form of governance in addition to the five that came before them.

And that's the kind of thing that only happens once every few hundred to every few thousand years, that's fundamental. Um, so that's going to help in every power structure that exists. Uh, there are corporations. Uh, it's not going to up in the existing corporations, but there are new networks that will be deployed that would have needed a central corporation that will now instead use a blockchain.

Uh, there are new, uh, groups, so people who are making rules amongst themselves and adjudicating themselves who might've needed an elite to do it, who will now use a blockchain based solution. Um, there are new open systems that would have suffered from the tragedy of the commons that want, because they'll use a blockchain based system.

Well, we get so far as to have a government running a blockchain. I don't know, maybe in my children's children's lifetime, but that's a long ways out, but along the way, I think we are going to see some of the fundamental functions of government. We'll see it, there are more efficiently done using a blockchain.

Um, for example, a blockchain based voting system would be, would be essentially as cheating proof. As you can create a system, you could audit exactly that everybody got to vote. Everybody who voted was entitled to vote was registered to vote, but you don't get to see what their actual. And it's done in a cryptographically secure way so that there's no Diebold, no corporation at the center that holds the voting machines.

There's no Republicans or Democrats sitting there and counting the votes and throwing out the third party votes or things like that. So that is an example of some piece of infrastructure government that is probably better done through a blockchain than by the government itself. Now, of course, governments don't want to give up power.

So that's going to be a struggle in the process, but I think we are going to see blockchains, remake, parts of government, uh, and eventually, maybe hundreds of years from now, you could actually see them replace a lot of government. Well, going back to your description about the election or your example, do you imagine that that would happen in, uh, Um, in an election, that's run by the government where they're choosing to create a blockchain based election, or are you imagining a decentralized?

My guess is what happened. Like always the government's always a final adopter of any technology solution. They're never the first adopter to the last adopter. Just take a look at the DMV and the post office, if you have any doubt about that. Um, so the way it's more likely to work is that small private organizations that do have internal links.

But are worried about cheating are worried about, you know, there are some very opposing groups on each side, you would see have them adopt a blockchain based solution. First, the brand new private organizations are just starting up. They're saying, Hey, there's this. And of course the infrastructure will need to exist.

So we're still in the infrastructure development phase, but five years from now, if you're starting a group that needs to have an election, like let's say you're electing a college president right on campus. And there's like the left wing and the right wing on campus. And they're really opposed to nobody trusts each other.

Some clever student is going to say. I'm just going to use this off the shelf, blockchain based wording mechanism that there's no different company built, you know, whether ICO money, uh, and it's open source. Anyone can audit it. It's running on the Ethereum blockchain. So it's completely cryptographically secure.

Uh, any student can. You log in with your student ID using your private key. So it can't be fake. We can show which students voted and each student can audit their vote and make sure that their vote was counted using zero knowledge proofs, but your vote doesn't actually get revealed. So your vote is completely private.

And then we can know beyond the shadow of a doubt that these were the exact vote outcomes. That seems like a much better solution. So I could see small private organizations adopting it, and then it grows and grows and grows and grows until one day, all the voters look at each other and say, why are we using this antique system for the big one?

When for all the little ones we're using this better system, it's sort of like how, when the iPhone first came out, Uh, corporate America was still all using blackberries and continue to use blackberries for awhile until finally the CEO who had an iPhone at home and a Blackberry in the work. And the CFO, when I found that home in Blackberry, went to the it person and said, what the heck are you doing?

It's time to get with the modern world. I don't care what you think about the security. I don't care what you think about your apps and your provisioning and all this stuff that used to defend your job. Just switch over to the iPhone already. And I don't care how it happens, right? So that same kind of technology adoption cycle needs to happen on blockchains, but that takes decades.

That's not an overnight thing. Um, so what are some like upcoming trends that you think we're going to see in crypto in the short-term future? I always find as much easier to predict long-term and short-term because short-term has to do with the vagrancy of humans and long-term, you can focus much more on the math and the protocols and the logic of it.

Um, if I had to guess, I think there was a wall of wall street money coming in. Lot of wall street money coming in. Uh, I do think I, I, this is more a hope than a prediction, but I am hoping that some of the top 20 currencies that are not that high quality do get recognized as such and, and, uh, you know, more of the money gets concentrated into the good currencies.

Uh, I hope that a lot more goes into development, uh, especially for high quality protocols. You have brilliant, uh, people, Stanford, MIT, Johns Hopkins, you know, and even less than the universities and places around the world. Um, and these crypto economists and crypto technologists, these people are worth their weight in gold, uh, and they should be financed such that they can do fundamental good research into governance and scaling.

Um, I hope that scaling gets much more addressed. That's a big one. Ethereum is trying to do it's proof of stake and sharding to get scaling going. Uh, Bitcoin now that is rejected to X needs to get its lightning litter deployed and actually functional so that the fees come down and the wait times can come down.

Um, think it would be great if. Uh, started basically putting more tortillas around crypto regulation, just like they did run internet regulation in the early days, um, to give it a chance to blossom. Uh, you know, I don't think new York's bit license helped anybody. Um, and it's not a surprise that they came out of the state where all of wall street is.

Um, so I get to the lobbyists there, you know, have a certain agenda, but nevertheless, it's sort of short set of New York to say, Hey, you know, we took over finance 1.0, where we're going to throw finance to point out the door and hope it doesn't happen somewhere else. Right. But this is not likely to be the case.

New York does not get to dictate the state of financial regulation, financial innovation for the entire planet. If anything, it's just ensuring it's going to end up like Detroit, uh, hollowed out as the industry moves on. So, uh, um, I'm hoping that some of these things will come to pass. Um, I hope also we'll just get better at things like custody.

So the average user doesn't have to worry about their private keys. Uh, we'll get better, but education. So, you know, your average person is running around and buying an ICO. Um, but rather they're trying to figure out what the high quality ones are or they're using an index, uh, or they're just realizing the inherently, highly volatile nature of these assets that they're holding small amounts, um, through, uh, good custodians.

Um, I think there's gonna be a lot of good technology development, uh, in the last two years when their hardware wallets got really good, for example, uh, more than two years ago, you didn't even have that solution, right. It wasn't very good. It didn't work well. Um, so I think we'll continue to see some stuff like that.

Um, I think everyone's still waiting for end user use cases where cryptocurrencies are better than existing currencies. We still haven't seen a lot of those. It's been a little surprising to me. I would have guessed that something like the collapse of the Venezuela and Boulevard, um, you know, would have led people to adopt cryptocurrencies there, but the infrastructure just hasn't been in place.

Your average Android phone or iPhone is still not geared up to be a good crypto to crypto platform. Um, but maybe in one or two years from now, it'll be good enough that people will actually start transacting in crypto, in places where the local currency essentially no longer works. And do you have any like big thoughts that are floating around in your head around crypto?

That you've just been thinking about recently that we didn't discuss, uh, you know, one thing I've been coming around to is, uh, it's taking a lot longer to solve even the basics. Like how do you scale Bitcoin? Uh, how do you build a secure, uh, multisig wallet on Ethereum, et cetera? Uh, you know, and. Really large changes like the Chinese government shutting down all crypto exchanges or Bitcoin cash coming up and competing with Bitcoin.

It might be more centralized or less centralized depending on it. So crypto is, if anything becoming more volatile, not less volatile. And so in that world, I think the right answer to where crypto heads from an end-user perspective will be that we may end up stopping. To talk about, is Bitcoin gonna win or is the theorem gonna win or is Monero gonna win or Z cash gonna win?

Uh, and we may end up focusing much more on having baskets of crypto and, uh, it didn't work with, uh, currencies because it's really hard for me to go down to the local store and say, here's a basket of the top 50 currencies in the world. Right? Because they don't know how to handle a symbolic way dollars, and they don't know how to handle Mexican pesos and all that stuff.

And they're limited by governments, but it's a nature of crypto that these things are, uh, completely electric. The wallets are completely in software. So if, for example, we could somehow agree every year. These are the top 10 crypto assets right now, and they're relatively stable and relatively high quality.

And they all have different governance mechanism, different levels of decentralization, different threat models and different adoption models that you could then say, okay, I'm going to give you top 10 basket. I'm going to buy it from you. I'm going to sell it from you. I'm going to hold a top 10 basket.

Um, and you could almost start using it as a currency. There's no fundamental law of software that says that it has to be one cryptocurrency at a time. So I think we may just get more comfortable with baskets. And I know this was tried in the real world with a European union. Originally had the, before the Euro, they had a special Euro basket instrument that comprise all the Euro currencies, but it was a temporary thing, but it.

Or the, um, the IMF has SDR special drawing rights or SDRs. Uh, they also call them, uh, which are sort of a basket kind of, uh, currency instrument. But I think we may actually see in the crypto world, in the software world that we create real baskets than actually be re used for real cases. And they're safer than any of the underlying cryptocurrencies.

So if there's a big hack on a single exchange or a full governance model of one currency collapses, or its encryption gets broken, or there's a bug in the software, it turns out to be a scam. You know, you lose 10% of where steel was little. It's almost like using a mutual fund or something as your currency.

That's right. Something like that. Yeah. It could happen to land. So it's just an idle thought. I don't know what the odds are, but it's fun to think about.

Um, all right, I'm going to ask you a personal question. It's one of my last questions. So can you run me out the door then? I've at least got my interview. What percentage of your net worth is in cryptocurrency? You're out the door?

No, I don't talk about private crypto holdings. I don't even hold them personally. I trust them. I trust them to all off and Lucas. Okay. Okay. All right. Well, this has been a great discussion. How can people get in touch with you? I'm on Twitter as at Nepal. Okay. All right. Well, thank you so much for coming on the show.
