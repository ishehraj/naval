Blockchain. And we've had a conversation in the past about, um, how right now, if you go across the border, are you carrying $10,000 in cash? You can carry it on your head. So what Bitcoin does is Bitcoin essentially says that, uh, money and speech are the same thing. And let me give you an example, a Swiss bank account.

If I know the number and I know the past, where to that, that is money, that is as good as money and I can cross borders with it. So they obviously can't stop you from crossing the border with money. If you have a bank council and we're remotely think of Bitcoin as a bank account in the cloud, and it's completely decentralized, not the Swiss government, not the American government.

Yeah. Participants in the network enforce it. Um, and so the ledger, the distributed database it's called the blockchain is held in the cloud by all the parties involved. It can't be broken by any of, any of them. It's cryptographically too strong. You would have to compromise the entire network to take over a Bitcoin.

Not even the NSA can do it. And the value of the Bitcoin. Uh, is a bounty on the Bitcoin. So if the value of all the Bitcoin in the world today is $5 billion. This is a $5 billion bounty, any hacker who can go break that and collect a lot of that money, but they can't. So it shows you how strong it is. Even the NSA couldn't break the blockchain today.

So I don't think so, but because of that, that means that Bitcoin is protected. The value is protected. The money is protected, but notice what I said at the beginning, right? The speech. That means a speech is protected. That means I can publish things into Bitcoin that no one can take away. I can publish Wiki leaks, for example, tracks of information into there that are irrevocable.

Well, I can explain that. Explain it, slow down, explain it. Blockchain is a giant database. That database is a $5 billion bounty on it, which is been valuable Bitcoin. So that's basically a $5 billion. Reward for breaking back to me, correct. You've got $5 billion, right. Or something close to it. You may not get rollout and approximation.

That's a reasonable assumption to make half a billion. Sure. So that's the bounty that protects the blockchain and the blockchain is a distributed database. And with an infinitesimal amount of Bitcoin, I can write anything into that database. And I think longterm Bitcoin is a currency of the internet. So even if humans don't.

Routers will use it. Web browsers. We'll use it. Uh, web servers we'll use it because a web browser server, let me bring this to the real world. Machines will use it. Sony would use this for all of the contracts to be able to stop what happened to them. Sony, Sony, Sony would use Bitcoin great encryption.

Right? So Bitcoin, uh, advances encryption, um, you and I. Bitcoin for a transaction to lock our contract or our money into the cloud. Uh, someone in China may use it for speech. They might use it to get a message out to the rest of the world anonymously in a way that it cannot be pulled back. So China may sensor YouTube, China may censor Twitter.

They won't be able to sensor a Bitcoin. There's no central authority. There's no, there's no one you can go to and say, uh, we're going to turn Bitcoin off. Turning Bitcoin off is the same as turning the internet off. So the moment the internet became truly pervasive, it was ineffable. That speech would become pervasive.

There's such, I mean, other than the obvious, the great firewall of China will fall. That's amazing in our lifetimes. Um, why is there such pushback on Bitcoin other than. It disrupts everything. It disrupts everything. If it works, it will be the greatest transfer of wealth in human history. Um, even if it doesn't work as advertised, it may still enable free speech and anonymous speech to a level that large states totalitarian states would be uncomfortable with.

Um, it may end up replacing. In other words, with, with the blockchain, somebody in North Korea. Can tell us what's happening in the prison camps and they can show us the videos and the pictures and it can't be traced back to them. Well, they'd have to be careful about it, but they're careful about it. Can't be traced.

It can't be pulled back. It can't be stopped. You can't turn off Bitcoin without turning off the internet. That's how it's designed. What the internet did people forget what the internet did? Was it connected every human to every human. And so because of that, It re it reduced the power of the elites. It reduced the power of mass media.

It reduced the power of control media. No one can control the message anymore. Okay. So let me go here because they're trying to air a lot of people today. These are libertarians and, uh, some of them are all for net neutrality, net neutrality to get the big government and are starting to get the big business.

And, uh, hold them to task. Although Google read and edited the 335 pages of regulation that we've not been allowed to see. Yeah, I think they mean, well, in that, they're basically saying, Hey, the Comcast and Verizon shouldn't be able to control what goes through the pipes. But I think the fascial bargain here's then you're saying, but then the federal government can control what goes through the pipes.

Right. So it depends what you think is the greater evil. Um, personally, I would rather take the oligopoly of two or five competing ISP, um, rather than the governments or to somebody. And at least there's a few of them, as opposed to just one, like I can't, I have to leave the country if I don't like the government policy.

Uh, but I understand where they're coming from, but fundamentally the internet will never truly free the human race until we have mesh networks that are not answerable to anyone. And that'll happen too, by the way, it's a mesh network. The technology already exists that would let my iPhone talk to your iPhone.

What's sitting in your pocket and I'll talk to her iPhone, his iPhone, and all the way down and just traveled around the world. So technology is not. Tower, it would eventually have to hit fiber and towers and those kinds of things. But you could, in theory, already construct the technology to get the message from one end of the U S to the other, without ever having to hit a central tower or cable.

This is very inefficient, but you can do it. Okay. That's that's the world that happens eventually. Maybe it's 20 years. Maybe it's 15, the years in the end here, we do people as long as they don't blow ourselves up. How concerned about that? Again, that's a tough one because, uh, you know, if the technology exists to blow up the world, there's AR there's always someone crazy enough to do it.

Um, and so that actually leads us to a logical conclusion that maybe we should have a pen Opticon maybe we should watch everybody, except it's just one loner who has to go off. So that that's one extent, you know how to answer. Maybe we go to space, maybe Elon Musk, scatter out, spread out everybody. It's always fascinating talking to you.

Thank you. Thank you.
