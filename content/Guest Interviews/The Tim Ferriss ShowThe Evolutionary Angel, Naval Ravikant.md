Optimal like this altitude, I can run flat out for a half mile before my hands start shaking familiar.

I'm a cybernetic organism living tissue.

So.

This episode is brought to you by wealth front. And this is a very unique sponsor. Wealth front is a massively disruptive in a good way, set it and forget it. Investing service led by technologists from places like apple and world famous investors. It has exploded in popularity in the last two years, and they now have more than two and a half billion dollars under management.

In fact, some of my very good friends investors in Silicon valley have millions of their own money in wealth front. So the question is why, why is it so popular? Why is it unique? Because you can get services previously reserved for the ultra wealthy, but only pay pennies on the dollar for them. And this is because they use smarter software instead of retail locations, bloated sales teams, et cetera.

And I'll come back to that in a second. I suggest you check out wealthfront.com forward slash Tim take the risk assessment quiz, which only takes two to five minutes. And they'll show you for free exactly the portfolio they'd put you in. And if you just want to take their advice, run with it, do it yourself.

Or as I would, you can set it and forget it. And here's why the value of Wealthfront is in the automation of habits and strategies that investors should be using regular basis. But normally aren't great investing is a marathon, not a sprint and little things that you may or may not be familiar with, like automatic tax loss, harvesting, rebalancing your portfolio across more than 10 asset classes and dividend reinvestment.

Add up to very large amounts of money over longer periods of time, wealth front. As I mentioned, since it's using software instead of retail locations, et cetera, can offer all of this at low costs that were previously completely impossible, right off the bat. You never pay commissions or account fees for everything.

They charge 0.2, 5% per year on assets above the first 15,000, which is managed for free. If you use my link, wealthfront.com forward slash Tim, that is less than $5 a month to invest a $30,000 account. For instance. Now, normally when I have a sponsor on this show, it's because I use them and recommend them in this case, it's a little.

I don't use Wealthfront yet because I'm not allowed to here's the deal. They wanted to sponsor this podcast. But because of sec regulations, companies that invest your money are not allowed to use client testimonials. So I couldn't be a user end, have them on the podcast, but I've been so impressed by wealth front that I've invested a significant amount of my own money, at least for me in the team and the company itself.

So I am an investor and hope to soon use it as a client. Now, back to the recommendation as a Tim Ferriss show listener, you'll get $15,000 managed for free.

Welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show, where it is my job to deconstruct world-class performers to tease out the routines habits, favorite books, et cetera, that you can apply to your own life. This time around, we have an in-between a sewed. It's not really an in between a suit. It is an experimental Q and a episode with.

the first episode we did with Nepal was a massive, massive success. It was nominated for podcast of the year novel at Nepal and Ava L on Twitter is the CEO and co-founder of angel list. He previously co-founded , which went public as part of shopping.com and vast.com. He is an active angel investor, a good buddy of mine, and has invested more than 100 companies, including quite a few unicorn mega successes.

His deals include Twitter, Uber Yammer, Postmates wish Thumbtack and open DNS open DNS was recently bought by Cisco for around $635 million in cash. So he's doing all right. And he has done. An incredibly diverse set of skills. And even if you have zero interest in startups or investing this episode, just like the one before it is well worth, the listen, Naval answers your questions, the top 10 questions that were submitted and upvoted on Reddit, and that ranges from artificial intelligence and his thoughts on the pros and cons the bull side of the bear side, if that makes any sense to money-making very practical, pragmatic Silicon valley or non Silicon valley money-making success.

What he would teach in school, favorite books, what is on his Kindle as we speak his most popular tweet of all time and the story behind it, the five chimps theory and how it applies to your life. Happiness hacks, conflict resolution, the list goes on and on. So siloed and have all on Twitter. Let him know what you thought.

Ask additional questions at Nepal and Ava L and please enjoy. This incredibly fascinating monologue with Naval Ravikant

hello, everybody. Welcome to the Tim Ferriss show. This is Navarro rabbit count. I will be now going through a large set of questions. Andrew PLIs asks, what are your thoughts on the AI industry, which seems to be dominated by an unusual amount of analytics, startups, most of which do the same thing in an anti zero to one fashion.

Yeah. So artificial intelligence is all the rage and people are writing books about it and talking about it. I'm thinking about it. I think anybody who's really talking right. True general purpose AI, the Skynet kind that'll take over the world and kill us all. Um, doesn't really write code much anymore because no one has yet made any of the fundamental breakthroughs, uh, required to get toward a general purpose.

AI. We're just basically making, writing simple. Code to what we've written in the past, but it's being executed faster or it's working with more data. Um, but the way in which the human brain works is actually very different than the way computers work. And I don't think the fundamental theoretical breakthroughs are in place for a general purpose AI.

So I think it's mostly technophiles or end of the world types or wishful thinking, um, in, in a weird way, uh, for people who think we're about to get a general purpose AI that said the field of AI has now broadened into specific AI. So computer vision, for example, self-driving cars, uh, drones that pilots themselves, these things are real, and they're using huge amounts of data as well as lots of processing power plus pretty good code to solve problems that before we would have thought or in the human domain, but the real test for AI is passing the Turing test, which is, can you trick someone can an AI trick.

So into thinking that they're actually human being, uh, and I think we are. Barely any closer to that than we were 20 or 30 years ago. Now there's another kind of AI that might emerge, which might be an emergent AI. For example, if you take all the computers in the world and you stitch them together, say through the internet, um, it could just happen that that much compute power, that much data, that much interaction could create something almost socially out of that computer network, a social AI.

But an AI like that is likely to be slowly softly emergent, probably not. Self-modifying in the way we think of a general AI, uh, and one, that's probably more designed to serve humans because it's emerges from a network, uh, that is built by humans, or it may also just co-exist or be completely woven into the human fabric in such a way that it might be inseparable for humanity itself.

Um, so I'm not too worried about, um, the general purpose AI. And I also don't think that, uh, uh, the general AI general purpose AI companies have have much of a future, but the specific AI companies, the ones that are solving a very specific problem, um, like computer vision example, uh, those I think could be very real.

Taylor Pearson asks, you mentioned cosas 1937 paper in your first interview and how tech is bringing down the transaction costs that led to corporatism. What do you think the job and labor market will look like in 20 years and how can people prepare? Well, I mentioned in the first interview that the industrial revolution sort of brought people together, cause a minimum efficient scale to, uh, do something, especially with a factory was very large.

So you need to have a hierarchy in India, people working for each other and working together. Now I think information technology is lowering the communication costs, lowering transaction costs, and people can be intermediate or even disintermediated by computers and work through computers. So the, you know, a not so great example is an Uber driver who would be getting orders through the, uh, Through a phone.

Um, but a better example, a more hopeful example might be, uh, independent contractors who are using Twitter and online sources to find jobs or, you know, angel list. We have tons of startup jobs. Are there places like pit crew or Gigster where you can go, um, get part-time jobs, E-Lance Craigslist, oDesk, et cetera.

Um, so I think that gig economy is going to be much more of the future and it can actually be a very positive development. For example, if you were a great journalist today, if you're a world-class journalist, you take great photographs, you report great news. You don't really need to go work for the New York times.

Um, if you are willing to start in your spare time with a blog with Twitter, you can build an independent brand. And although you might start off making no money early. Kind of near the end of the curve when you're a YouTube star or a blog or a very popular blogger, you can literally be charging people for access to your blog and you can be making a very good and very independent living where you're getting paid for books and newsletters and working from wherever you want.

So I think the best way to prepare for the future 20 years is find something you love to do. So you have a shot at being one of the best people in the world at it, build an independent brand around it with your name, not with a company's name or with other people's names around it. Try to make it creative work.

So you'll stay interesting. You stay ahead of the game. Anything that's not creative society can replicate and then not pay you full value over time. So it's better to all this solve new problems and doing new things and get connected. With working in a boom-bust fashion where a couple of weeks at a time you may have a lot of work.

And then a couple of weeks at a time you're on vacation. So I think that's kind of where the future is headed. It'll be a gradual, uh, and then it will be sudden, um, but the, the best way to prepare it is to just not give up your induction. And it's in the first place I showed his audiences. Confucius says that you have two lives and the second one begins when you realize you only have one.

When and how did your second life begin? It's a really deep question. I think. Most people who are past a certain age have had this feeling or phenomenon where they've gone through most of life, a certain way, and then gotten to a certain stage and then had to make some pretty big changes. And I'm definitely also in that boat.

I think for me, for me, it was, I struggled for a lot of my life to, uh, have certain material cereal and social successes. And when I achieved those material and social successes, or at least beyond the point where they didn't matter as much to me anymore, I realized that my peer group and a lot of the people who were around me and the people who had achieved the similar successes and were on their way to achieving more and more successes just didn't seem all that happy.

And, uh, and in my case, there was definitely a hedonic adaptation and very quickly get used to anything. So. Let me to the conclusion, which seems trait, uh, that happiness is internal. Uh, and so then that set me on a path of starting to work more on my internal self, uh, and realizing that all real success is internal and has very little to do with external circumstances.

But one has to do the external thing. Anyway. That's how you're biologically hardwired to it's it's clipped. So you can just turn it off. You have to do it, and you have to have your own life experience that then brings you back onto the internal path. So for me, it was just basically getting what I wanted was the price.

Very related to that. Daniel D 1 61 asks, do you feel an inner urge to know yourself fully and has your worldly success satisfied this urge? Um, I would say, yeah, I absolutely do have an inner urge to know myself fully. Uh, and if anything, the worldly success has taken has, has taken me further away from satisfying that urge the more worldly success you have.

Um, the more your ego gets built up, the more fearful you might be a losing it all, the more you care, what other people think, the more you have to lose, uh, the more you get caught up in this dream of who you think you are. And, uh, so I think worldly success actually hurts. If, if from a young age, you know, that you want to know yourself and discover yourself much better.

If you have that foresight or insight at an early age, then, uh, material success will actually take you away from it. Uh, I'm not Christian, but there is that famous line in the Bible, uh, that, you know, Jesus is easier than, uh, you know, a camels and go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into heaven.

And I think I, I understand what. Recipe in 89, says in the first episode, they've all talked about a few topics that should be taught in school rather than learning the Capitol on Montana. Uh, he brought up topics like teaching what he knows that worked for him and happiness, nutrition, et cetera. Can you ask him to elaborate on some of these particularly happiness?

Yeah. I mean, if I'm running a, uh, grade school curriculum for children, um, I would probably optimize happiness, nutrition, diet, exercise. How do you build good habits? How do you break bad habits? How do you have good relationships? How do you find your spouse meditation? How do you build basic skills? Uh, not memorize, lots of facts.

Uh, what kinds of books should you read? Preferably older ones, not newer ones that have stood the test of time. I'd probably have them run a lemonade stand or a small business, uh, and you know, earn money. And so they can understand how that works. Uh, probably have them work on something charitable related.

Take them to the third world and show them suffering true suffering so they can get some context, um, probably teach them public speaking, business, writing, basic persuasion. Um, maybe a little bit of programming on top of the reading, writing, arithmetic. I probably eliminate chunks of geography history. Um, maybe, uh, honestly even second and third languages music, unless they have musical inclinations.

And I know this is going to horrify some people, but the time has to come from somewhere. So the question is, what do you emphasize? Um, so I think it's not necessarily good to educate every child in everything. You have to find out what their aptitude is for and what's more practical. And we're now living in the Wikipedia era, we're living in the internet era.

So a lot of the factual memorization that used to go on is now completely irrelevant. You can just look, get up. Um, so those kinds of things I think need to go away. I mean, think about the fact that, uh, if you have young children right now, or you're planning on having children, that your children probably will not need to know how to drive.

Um, so there's all kinds of time savings to be had, and it can be used for these other things. Um, the happiness one is a very complex topic. Um, I actually don't think happiness is its own thing. I think a lot of what we think of as happiness is actually this pleasure, uh, it's physical pleasure either from, oh, that tasted good, or it might be momentary pleasure from, oh, she loves me or he loves me.

Um, but I think true happiness comes out of peace. Uh, and peace comes out of many things, but it comes out of fundamentally understanding yourself. It comes from looking inside yourself and understanding how much of. You're reacting to our emotional reactions or attachment is self-inflicted suffering.

It's desire that you have for things that you probably shouldn't care that much about. Um, there's a great line that my brother Kemal quoted in his book. He has a great book called love yourself. Like your, like your life depends on it. And another one called live your truth. He's actually the philosopher and the family.

I'm just the amateur. But, uh, he had a great line in there where he said, I once asked him a monk. You know, uh, what, what is your secret to peace and happiness? And the monk said, I say yes to everything that happens. I say, yes. And that's very hard for us to imagine because in life we're used to fighting for everything we used to getting whatever we want.

We're used to reacting. We're used to immediately saying that stinks. That's good, that's bad. We're used to constantly judging things. And the act of judging something separates you from that thing. And over time as you judge a judge, you invariably judge people, you judge yourself, you separate yourself from everything.

And then you end up only, and the feeling of disconnection and loneliness is what eventually leads to suffering. And then you struggle. You resist against the world the way it is, and that. Is what your ego does. It helps you operate in the real world by resistant games against things that you don't like.

Um, and that is a source also a lot of unhappiness. So I actually think happiness is the absence of suffering. It comes from peace and that comes from just being very careful about desire, judgment, and reactions, realizing that you don't really need something anymore. That, that, that something is not important to you.

So to get very practical about it. I have a whole series of tricks that I use to try and be happier in the moment. And I started doing these a few years ago and at first they were silly and difficult and required a lot of attention, but now some of them have become second nature. And I think doing them, I've just religiously.

I've managed to increase my happiness level quite a bit. Um, the obvious one is meditation, um, and insight meditation. Uh, so working towards a specific purpose on it, which is to try and understand how my mind works, but then just being very aware in every moment. So if I catch myself judging somebody, then.

I can stop myself and say, well, what's the positive interpretation of this. So, um, I used to get annoyed about things. Now. I always look for the positive side of it and it used to take a rational effort. It used to take a few seconds for me to come up with a positive. Um, now I can do it sub second. My brain is trained to do it automatically.

Um, similarly, I try, you know, there are other hacks that could try to get more sunlight on my skin. That's an easy cheap one. Look up and smile. Uh, tell yourself, tell your friends that you're a happy person. Then you'll be forced to be, uh, to conform to it. You'll have the consistency bias. You have to live up to it.

Your friends will expect you to be a happy person. These are little hacks. I mean, they add up over time. They're not going to pull you out of a severe depression. That's a much deeper, more difficult thing, but if you're just trying to upgrade your happiness ever so slightly, um, you can do it. Another hack would be just any time you catch yourself, desiring something say, is it really that important to me that I'd be unhappy unless this goes my way.

And you're going to find the vast majority of things. That's just not true. Um, I think in dropping caffeine made me happier. It made me more of a stable person working out every day. Makes me happier. If you have peace of body, you'll have, it's much easier to have peace of mind. Um, so there's, there's lots and lots of these things I can go on.

This could be a full podcast, um, but I'm still discovering and learning these things myself. Uh, I think it, it would be interesting to maybe catalog them. Um, but I suspect that a lot of them are deeply, deeply personal. If I step back for a second and answer the question properly, the most important. Trick.

I think to being happy is to realize that happiness is a skill that you develop and a choice that you make you choose to be happy. And then you work at it. It's just like building muscles is just like losing weight. It's just like succeeding at your job is just like learning calculus. You decide it's important to you.

You prioritize it above everything else. You read everything on a topic and then you work at it. Uh, and again, I think the Buddhists have done a lot of good work on this. I don't think modern science has good answers here. I think the modern world is actually a really bad. The modern world is full of distractions.

Things like Twitter and Facebook are not making you happy. They're actually making you unhappy. Um, you're essentially playing a game that's created by the creators of those systems. And yes, it can be a useful game once in a blue moon, but most of the time you're just wasting your time. You're engaging in envy dispute and, um, resentment comparison, jealousy, anger about things that frankly just don't.

The refined ban asks, how do you tend to handle conflict when it arises? Huh? Um, I handle conflict very poorly. Uh, I get angry. I'm an angry person, so I have to catch myself in the moment and I have to talk myself down. I have to recognize the anger for what it is. I have to sense the bodily reactions, and then I have to see if I can stay calm.

And usually it's really hard for me. It's my nature to try and solve a problem. The moment arises. I don't do well with long-term stress where there's an unsolved problem hanging out there. Probably the single best piece of advice I can give other than being mindful and just aware when you're engaging in conflict is to not associate with high conflict people.

Um, when someone is, when we all know people in our life who just tend to get a little more angry, a little more judgmental, or they're always in a fight with somebody else, if you see someone who's always fighting with somebody else, they're eventually going to fight. So I have just slowly cut those people out of my life, not in an overt explicit way, but just by choosing to hang out with them less and less, there are plenty of smart, successful kind and happy people in the world.

And you just have to make space for them in your life, by letting the people who still have lessons to learn, drift off and go learn their lessons. It's not your job to educate them. Um, sometimes very unhappy people sort of have this air about them, like a drowning person where they're thrashing and making a big ruckus.

But if you, if you grab them and try to save them, uh, unless you're an extremely happy person yourself, you're going to drown too. So, uh, I would say the first rule of, uh, of handling conflict is don't hang around. People who are constantly engaging in calls. What insight about life? Have you acquired? That seems obvious to you, but might not be obvious to everybody else.

This is a tough one. It's a deep question. Um, I do have one fundamental recent belief that have acquired the last few years that I don't think most people would agree with. Uh, but it's such a personal thing. And it came about in such. Uh, personal circumstances that I'm not sure anybody else would get there in the same line of reasoning that said I laid out anyway, which is I'm not afraid of death anymore.

And I think a lot of the struggle that we have in life comes from a deep, deep fear of death. Uh, and it can take, its, it can take form in many ways. Uh, one can be that, uh, you know, we want to write the great American novel or we really want to achieve something that's worldwide, build something we want to, um, you know, build a great, um, uh, piece of technology or we wanna start an amazing business or we want to run for office and make a difference.

Um, and a lot of that just comes from sort of this fear that we're going to die. So we have to build something that lasts beyond us. Uh, obviously also the obsession that parents have with their children. I mean, a lot of that is warranted and biological love, but some of that is also the quest for immortality, even some of the beliefs and some of the more outlandish parts of organized religion, I think fall into that.

And I don't have the quest for immortality anymore. And I think I came to this fundamental conclusion. Um, I thought about it a lot. And we've been, the universe has been around for a long time, very, very large place. If you're steady, even the smallest bit of science you'll realize that for all practical purposes, we are nothing where we're like we are amoeba we're bacteria to the universe.

Um, uh, we're, we're basically monkeys on a small rock orbiting, a small backwards star in a huge galaxy, which is in an absolutely staggering VH again, universe, which itself self-made, you're part of a gigantic multi-verse and. Universe has been around probably for 10 billion years or more, and will be around for tens of billions of years afterwards.

So your existence, my existence is, is just infinitesimal. It's like a Firefly blinking once in the night. So we're not really here very long and we don't really matter that much and nothing that we do lasts. So eventually you will fade, your works will fade. Your children will fade. Your thoughts will fade.

This planet will fade. The sun will fade. It'll all be gone. Their entire civilizations that we just remember now with one or two words like Samarian or a Mayan, you know, do you know any Sumerians or Mayans? Do you hold any of them in high regard or esteem? Have they outlived their natural lifespan? So how no.

So I think we're just here. Greenly short period of time. Now from here, you can choose to believe in an afterlife or not. And if you really do believe in an afterlife, then that should give you comfort and make you realize that maybe, you know, everything that goes in this life is not that consequential.

Uh, on the other hand, if you don't believe in an afterlife, then you should also come to a similar conclusion. We should realize that this is such a short and precious life. That it's really important that you don't spend it being unhappy. There's no excuse for spending most of your life in misery.

You've only got 70 years out of the 50 billion or so the universe is going to be around and whatever your natural state is, it's probably not this, this is your living state, your dead state. Uh, it's true. Over a much longer timeframe. So when I think about the world, that way, I sort of realize that it's just kind of a game, um, which is not.

You go to a dark place and you start acting on that and ethically and morally quite the contrary, you realize just how precious life is and how, uh, it's important to make sure that you enjoy yourself. You sleep well at night. Um, you're a good moral person. You're generally happy. You take care of other people, you help out, but you can't take it too seriously.

You can't get too hung up over it. You can't make yourself miserable or unhappy over it. You just have a very short period of time here on this earth. Nothing you do is going to matter that much in the long run. Don't take yourself so seriously. Uh, and then that just kind of helps make everything also work.

So, yeah, that's a, that's an insight about life that I've acquired that now seems obvious to me. Um, but it's really not. I think obvious to most people. Related to that protect Steven asks what's your philosophy of life or grand goal in living. In other words of the things in life you might pursue, which is the thing you believe to be most valuable.

Another great question. I think before, when I had the usual quest for immortality fear that almost all of us do, that's coded into our genes and that was driving me. I was trying to build lasting things, create things, make money, build businesses, write books, that sort of thing. Now I realize a lot of that is meaningless.

That's just stuff that keeps us busy. It's entertaining. It might have some social good. It might help build us as a moral character and human beings, but it's not really the purpose of life. Is there a purpose of life? That's, that's tough. Is there a philosophy of life that's tough? Uh, I think the closest I can articulate and I'll probably change my mind on this next year is to keep growing and learning, um, in the short period of time that you have, uh, to seek truth and to accept things the way they are to, to see the world the way it really is.

Uh, and then just to live your life. I think that's it. I think any deeper meanings or goals just lead to ideologies, which lead to desires and belief systems and disappointments and conflict. Um, it's better just to live the life that you have on this earth. Enjoy it while you go try and see things the way they truly are, not the way you wish they were.

Um, and to be in harmony with things the way that they are easier. A number of people asked me what books I'm reading now. And this is a very difficult question to answer because at any given time, I probably about 50 books in my Kindle and probably about six or seven hard cover or soft cover physical books that I'm cycling through.

So literally I opened up my Kindle. I look through based on my mood, I'll flip to whichever book, uh, matches up to my mood. I'll flip to whatever part of it looks the most. Interesting. And I'll just read that part. So I don't read in a sequential order. And the most important thing that does for me is it lets me just eat, sorry, that's me read on a regular basis.

Um, and so I can actually just pull up my Kindle here and I can read off the names of some of these books that I'm reading. Um, I can give you a mini reviews, but I haven't actually finished any of them. So they're all in progress. So at any given time, I was reading some science fiction because Saifai has always very imaginative, um, in terms of, uh, hypothesizing, how the world is going to work out.

Um, usually has an interesting point of view. You learn a little science. Um, so just based on friends' recommendations, I've been flipping through, uh, Greg Egan, brilliant writer, physicist, um, I believe who has written some very hardcore Saifai stories. Um, so, but reading a book from him called distress, um, I've always got collections of science fiction.

Uh, I finished the Martian, which was decent, but I felt like it went on a little bit too long. I know it's a very popular book with, with some people, um, love graphic novels. So I've been rereading the boys recently, which is one of my favorite graphic novels of all time getting into kind of the more, uh, evolution science kind of books.

Um, Matt, Ridley's the evolution of everything. I recommend everything by Matt Ridley, actually. I think he's great. Um, so I really highly, highly recommend picking up a genome, the red queen origins of virtue, the rational optimist, and the evolution of everything that I'm reading, uh, the essential Gandhi, Mahatma Gandhi, um, in reading.

Um, let's see, I've got here, the dowel philosophy, Alan Watts. Uh, I've got, uh, Illusions Richard bark, which I read before, but I'm flipping through again. I just liked the way it's it flows the better pro procrastinate. Jeez, aphorisms by Nassim Taleb. Who's famous for the black Swan and fooled by randomness.

Um, but I sort of like his collection of ancient wisdom in the better ProQuest is, um, The lessons of history by willing Ariel Durant, which was actually recommended by one of the listeners in the first podcast, a great book. I really like how it summarizes some of the larger themes of history, very incisive and unlike most history books is actually really small and it covers a lot of ground.

Um, I've actually been reading my brother's book. I just finished how to love yourself. Like your life depends on it. And I thought it was great. Very succinctly written, obviously a plug for my bro. Um, as I was reading fear and loathing in Las Vegas, although I think I'll put that down. I get it. But halfway through, it's just a giant drug fueled orgy by hunter S Thompson and his friends so that it was entertaining, but I sort of gave up after a bit, um, Richard Fineman, uh, I've been reading perfectly reasonable deviations and also reading genius, rereading.

Um, I'm rereading the power of myth by Joseph Campbell. Sometimes I think it's better just to reread the grades than it is to read something. You know, that's not as great. Um, in the philosophy side I've been reading rereading the doubt, Ching, uh, and, uh, and I just finished, uh, falling into grace by aria Shanti, which I thought was very good.

Um, let's see. Um, also read some Jed McKenna recently. He's a weird one. I'm not sure I'd recommend him for everybody. Uh, God's debris by Scott Adams. Uh, very interesting. Um, the gin of consciousness and the breakdown of the by camera on mine. There's a mouthful for you by Julian, James, um, mastering the core teachings, the Buddha by Daniel Ingram.

That's a great book actually recommended to me by a friend, uh, it's available online. Um, I would, I would get that one. I thought it was for if you're interested in Buddhism, meditation insight. Uh, I thought that one was a great, uh, one that brought everything together while leaving the room some out of it.

Um, so yeah, I mean, that's, that should give you an indication. I'm always reading something by Christian and Morty. Usually it's total freedom, which is the book that I just reread over and over the most, very difficult book doesn't necessarily make sense for everybody, but when you're ready for it, there's nothing else.

I also recently finished the power of habit, uh, or close to finished as close as I ever get. Uh, that one was interesting, not because of its content necessarily, but just because it's good for me to always keep and top of mind how powerful habits are habits are everything. Humans are basically habit machines.

We form habits, and we run those habits all day long and have going to be great because they help us get things done very efficiently without having to reprocess them all the time. They can also be terrible because we can have addictions. Those are the obvious bad habits, but also they allow us to go through our life unconsciously and mindlessly.

So it's very important to be aware of your habits and know how to break habits and know how to make habits. Um, and you know, I have this daily workout that I do that I think I mentioned in the last podcast and a lot of people ask about it. I think that one is interesting, but the specific technique matters less.

The most important thing. Doing some kind of physical activity every single day. And if you can make it the same activity at the same time, because that right there will teach you the power of habits. If you do something seven days a week with no exceptions and you work out early in the morning, or when you first get up, um, then it will automatically fix all kinds of other bad habits that you have.

Uh, you can't be out drinking late at night. You can't be out partying. Uh, you can't sleep in. Consume too much caffeine. Um, there are all kinds of other habits in your life that may be bad to get fixed. If you stick to your daily workout habit, and then it teaches you what the power of a habit is. And then as you shed other bad habits, then you realize that habits can be.

Um, and you started breaking them. So I think learning how to break habits is actually a very, very important meta skill that can serve you better in life than almost anything else. And although you can read tons of books on it and I recommend you, shouldn't go read all the books on it. Uh, the reality is you're never going to learn how to break bad habits until you just break them.

And so one thing I try to do is I try and break a bad habit every six months, and I try and pick up a good habit every six months a year. Um, and you, you can't beat yourself up too much on it, but I don't think it's too much to ask. If you were to save yourself in 2016, I'm going to break one bad habit.

I'm going to do everything in my power just to take down that one habit and everything else will be static. I'm not going to get new worse, but, uh, that will, that will help move the ball forward. And then you get gradual improvements in your life that you see. Like I used to be pretty overweight, uh, and I've lost weight over the last decade where now I feel I'm pretty fit and healthy and it hasn't come through any single big epiphany or realization.

Uh, although definitely going paleo help and understanding low-carb helped, um, and help and getting rid of processed foods helped and all those kinds of things. It came from it mainly came from just habit changes and changing habits slowly but steadily over the course of a decade. So the good news is I've almost never slid backwards.

I don't, and I've never felt danger, regaining the weight that I've lost. Uh, and now at the age of 42, I'm probably within one pound of my life, this weight since I was an adult. Um, and I think that just comes from having stacked on a bunch of good habits and haven't gotten rid of a bunch of bad habits.

Um, so I would say the power to make and break habits, learning how to do that is really important. Um, and if you're gonna, if you're gonna leave this podcast, Pick up two skills in life, I would say. And it depends on the person, because many of you, I mean, Tim's entire audience is a bunch of overachievers.

So, um, many of you are aware ahead of me on both of these, but for those of you who, who may be behind on one of them, I would say first realize that happiness is a choice and it is a skill and you can dedicate yourself to learning that skill and making that choice and telling people about it and working on it.

And you can slowly but steadily over the course of years, make yourself happier. And similarly, I would say that habits are breaking habits is. And it is something you can learn and start with a small habit and try different techniques to break it. Try substituting, try, uh, going cold Turkey, try weaning yourself off, try social proof by telling other people that you're going to break the habit.

Um, try putting other habits around it that leave you no time for that habit. Try removing the triggers, try toning down the rewards. Um, do whatever it takes, but break one bad habit this year. And once you pick up that scale, it's a beautiful thing because then slowly you can shed all your bad habits and make room for good habits in your.

Break out list asked a big bunch of questions. I'm going to answer just one of them right now, come back to yours later, break out. This says what personal efficiency or life management things do you do on a semi-regular basis, EG some kind of life review exercise where you read certain categories in your life, et cetera.

The answer is not, I am lazy that way. I choose to live a spontaneous and free life. I don't want to live a very structured life. Um, I know people who are married, friends of mine who are married and they actually have quarterly meetings with their wife and they have, you know, reports and how are we performing as a marriage and what are the objectives and what are our key results?

And you know, what sort of one-year plan, what's our five-year plan. And I just don't plan. I'm not a planner. I prefer to live in the moment and be free and flow and be happy. Um, I think projecting too much in the future, judging yourself, setting yourself up in very difficult ways. Other than, as I talked about just that one habit or one desire, um, Uh, trying to, uh, control yourself on a micro basis.

We try and micromanage yourself. All you're going to do is make yourself miserable and you're going to get nothing done. So just focus on the one or two really, really important things and everything else just surrender to it. Just take it as it comes to success, it, be happy with it. Be glad that you're on this world.

Be glad that you're clothed and fed and that you're not getting bombs dropped in your head. Um, like some people in the world are and, uh, you know, just it's I think it's, I think I like to stay free because that way I can see the little miracles in life, you know, and there are little miracles everywhere.

It's just. We have taken them for granted the fact that you're wearing clothes, the fact that you have enough food to eat the fact that you're in a, in a place of shelter. Yes. You can roll your eyes about it. Yes. You can say. Yeah, that's obvious everybody has it, but actually not everybody has it. Uh, it would be great to go take a trip to a third world country or to a refugee camp and see how little some other people have.

Um, and I think, uh, it's a bad habit that we developed that we, uh, forget how to appreciate, uh, what we do have. And so I'm not obsessing about the future and not beating yourself up over what you don't have is very important because then you can actually pay attention and be grateful for what you do.

Have faced is to ask for more book recommendations, especially any book recommended by listeners in the podcast, last podcast that stood out and had an impact in your life. Yeah, actually the last podcast was a treasure trove in a comment section of good books. Um, and. You know, I, uh, I recommended and I got back even more great books.

So I must've bought at least 10 or 15 books, uh, just from the comment section and a couple that I've read really stood out to me. Um, I mentioned the lessons of history. I thought that was really good. Uh, too soon, old, too late. Smart. That was a fun light read. Uh, By Gibran, which I had actually never read, but it literally read like a modern day, poetic religious tome, um, you know, up there with the Bhagavad Gita, the doubted chain, the Bible, the Qur'an, it sort of was written in that style where it had that feel of religiosity and truth, but it was very approachable and beautiful and nondenominational and non, uh, secretary.

And, um, so I, I really liked that, love that book. Uh, I, he, he has a gift for poetically describing what children are like, what lovers are like, what marriage should be like. Um, you know, how you should treat your enemies and your friends, how you should work with money. Um, what can you think of, of, uh, you know, every time you have to kill something to eat it, how do you deal with that?

Um, so I felt like, like the great religious books, it gave a very deep, uh, very philosophical, but very true answer. To how to approach the major problems in life. Uh, I recommend the prophet for everybody, whether you're religious or not, uh, or whether you are, um, Christian or Hindu or Jewish or atheist, I think it's a beautiful book and it's worth reading.

So thank you to whoever recommended that. Now I'm going to switch gears for a second. And the final section is podcasts. I'm going to just focus on the questions that are very vocational focused. It's funny. I got a whole bunch of questions that say probably about two thirds were about philosophy and life and reading and learning and growth.

And those are fun for me to answer because it's a new field for me, myself, and I learned from it too, by talking about it and by hearing responses about it. But, uh, there's a set of questions that, uh, are very particular about how do I make money? How do I get good venture capitalists, how to run my company, et cetera.

And I've been sort of putting those off because to me, those are almost old hat, but I'm going to answer those now in this section. So let me go through those. And I know I covered a few of those before, but all the remaining ones from this point out are very practical. So if you were more interested in the philosophical issue, Uh, or the books then, uh, this is, uh, then we're done with that section.

You could probably just stop the podcast. Um, if you want to ever discuss any of those topics, the best way to find me is on Twitter. You can find me at as at novel and a V a L. And, uh, I'm usually reasonably responsive there as long as it's not too. Open-ended, it's kind of an interesting conversation. So let's dive right into it.

Um, the money-making questions, Vic rush said, let's assume that you're in your late twenties with no real money, college education. You decide to begin your journey with business and startups. What would you begin with? What would you do? Oh yeah. And you don't live in SF. Well, unfortunately I'd say move to SF.

And if you can't move to SF move to a startup hub, and that could include depending on where you are in the country, that could be Austin. That could be LA. That could be New York. That could be in Boston. That could be Berkeley. And that could be London. It could be bank. It could be Shanghai could be even parts of Delhi or Beijing.

Um, so, uh, unfortunately all the other people who are in startups are in these places. So you have to get in the flow. Now, the good news is once you get in the flow, you're going to figure out you're motivated, um, what to do. Uh, you will be able to maybe go to a school where you can learn how to code, and there's tons of them around have tons of great academy like app academy and hack reactor, and general assembly does classes where you can learn how to code.

You can volunteer for startups. Um, you can, you know, start up in maybe customer service or you can start off in operations or in, uh, you know, just keeping the office running, do whatever it takes, but get into the startup scene. And startups are moved forward by people who are just willing to do the work.

And you don't necessarily have to be a genius or have to have a technical background, but if it won't do the work and you're willing to learn and you're in the right hub, um, you'll, you'll figure your way out within a couple of days. Duet 14 says you study computer science and economics. How have these fields impacted your thinking?

And if you could go back, would you still pursue the same education and why or why not? Um, I would pursue similar. I would say that micro economics is incredibly useful. Macro economic. Mostly useless. Um, the part of computer science that was, uh, very theoretical, like algorithms and mathematics was actually the most useful because that stuff doesn't change over time.

The part that was learning to program in Java or Fortran was useless or less useful because it fades over time. Um, so I would probably do more math, more physics, um, stick to micro everything. Um, and I would have probably studied some psychology and some evolution, uh, because I think those are really important to understanding how humans work.

And at the end of the day, you're interacting with humans everywhere you go. Uh, I would have focused on theory and principles over facts because facts, fade or facts can be looked up. Um, and yeah, probably the most important skill is not really even what, what you major in, what you study, if just knowing how to learn.

And yeah, if you have a good grasp of mathematics and if you'd like to read, there's nothing you can't learn on your own. Be 10th man ass. Hey Tim. And the question from an 18 year old in the Philippines, what advice would you give to ambitious 18 year olds who want to be successful in founding startups and investing like you Naval?

Huh? Um, basically the question is how do I get as rich as you, but faster? Uh, cause nobody wants to win at a time. Well, uh, as I said before, a first moved to a startup hub, if you're going to be in that industry or just go to the hub for whatever your industry is. So if you want to be an actor and go to Hollywood, if you'd be in Broadway, go to New York, if you want to be in finance, go to New York or London or Hong Kong.

Um, second. Yeah, I think Charlie Munger had a great answer to this. Charlie Munger is Warren Buffett's right-hand man. And he gets asked these kinds of things all the time. He's a self-made multi-billionaire and very wise in his ways. And I think I'm going to paraphrase a Mangler. Then you should look it up.

He basically said, you know, you just get up early in the morning. Um, you work really hard. You'll learn something every day. You put one foot in front of the other. And uh, if you live long enough, eventually you will get what you deserve and that's it. So there's no certainty in life. You can put in the hours, you can put in the time.

Um, but you can't really expect the outcome. Unfortunately, one of the, one of the things that investing has really taught me is just how much randomness there is in the world. How many times you think you can do something right? But it still doesn't work out. So I often see that, you know, individual entrepreneurial efforts often fail, but individual entrepreneurs over their careers rarely fail.

As long as you can keep taking shots on goal. Uh, and you keep getting back up. Eventually it'll get through. So. Just stick at it. And although you might win early, that's rare. Uh, those stories are very, very rare. Um, more likely you just have to put in the time and people who tend to win very early in life, don't learn the right lessons.

Uh, they tend to lose that money. In fact, I made a small fortune when I was very young, just by being in the right.com bubble company, uh, in 1999. And then of course I held onto it too long and I lost the whole thing. Um, and that was a really good lesson because it meant that as I made a little bit of money later in life, now I knew how rare and precious it was.

And I knew how to hang on to it. Uh, I didn't have, uh, the contempt for money that comes from making it too easily. Um, I had a deep respect for how hard it is to make. Um, so put in the hours. Perfect. Steven asks, what advice would you give a talented software engineer who is a Google Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon continues to work.

Would they, should they continue to work there and get promoted? Should they move to an established startup like Airbnb? Should they move to an early stage startup or should they bootstrap a software product or should they found a startup and play the VC funded game. And is there a slight conflict of interest between advice to would be founders from investors?

Well, yes, investors giving advice, uh, is as always self-serving advice. Um, so don't take your advice from an investor that you can help it because they have their particular view of the world. And just realize that, uh, incentives are everything. Charlie Munger, who I mentioned earlier says incentives are super powers.

And he also said, if you can be working on incentives, then you shouldn't be working on anything else. He means like in the context of with your employees or your product incentives are everything. Uh, that said, what path should you take? Heck, I don't know. I mean, they're all good pads. Uh, it depends what you want out of life.

You could try them all. Um, if, you know, you want to start a company, you know what the company is and you know who you want to do it with, and you feel like you have a good understanding of the space, then go do it. You're ready. On the other hand, if you don't know how to do it, or you don't yet know what it is, then you should probably get as close to it as possible.

And that would mean joining a startup. Um, and if you want to be a founder, then you probably want to join a startup. That's pretty early. Um, if you're more interested in making, uh, having a good lifestyle or making money for your family, um, then you may want to go to a later stage startup one that is more clearly on the path of success.

So I think this question is like this. Unfortunately don't have glib answers. There's highly, highly contextual. The fact that you were thinking about, it means you're going about it the right way. Startups are a young person's game. It's better to do them early in life. Before you settled down before you have too many obligations before you've gotten kind of set in your ways.

Um, so if you, if you're going to do a startup, you should at least take one shot at it before you're 30 or 35. After that, I find it gets a lot harder. That's me personally, though, there are plenty of great entrepreneurs who are executing in their forties and fifties and sixties. And I think T Boone Pickens, who's still an entrepreneur and operators, something as eighties or something like.

That's a very practical question. What is your advice to those on U S visas? How can they go about launching a startup in the valley of keeping their primary job in the short term and what communities and incubators can they reach out to for help and advice? Actually, there's a, there's a great accelerator incubator that I'm a small investor in called unshackled.

I think they're unshackled.co and what they solve exactly this problem. They help great engineers, designers, entrepreneurs start companies while retaining their visa status. And they have a way to work that out. That's perfectly legal and ethical and good. Um, and it helps immigrants create jobs and create wealth and create products for the rest of us.

Um, so I highly recommend checking out unshackled, um, and, uh, there may be others. Like it, that's just the one that I happened to be aware. Trail Vinyasa. Good question. In a world where the majority of people will guard money much more than time. How do you protect your own time and still not offend people or damaged relationships, both professionally and personally, any strategies or good reads on this?

You could suggest. Yeah, this is the bane of my existence. I get hit up for coffees, lunches, meetings, obligations to do's phone. Um, for a little while, I was a little ornery about it and I used to own the domain. I don't do coffee.com and I would reply to emails from Navarro that I don't do coffee.com. Uh, but that was rude and stupid.

And that was the petulant younger, more brash version of me. Uh, these days I've become sort of a master at evading, uh, meetings that suck up time. The reality is time is all you have in this world. And when you're young, you're seeking out opportunities. So you look forward to serendipity, you're taking your meetings, dynamics, energizing.

You're meeting people. As you get older, you have too much opportunity. You're too many people. You have too much family obligations. You have too many things to do too many places you could be. And then you just end up busy, busy, busy, busy, busy, and busy as the, the death of productivity and happiness.

Derek Sivers who I think Tim had a great podcast with said, you know, I'm not going to say yes or no. I'm going to say hell yes or no. Like basically, unless I'm really excited about something, I'm not going to do it. I think that's a good, uh, heuristic to try out. Um, and you know, so what if it offends people, uh, you have a very short life on this earth.

You have to spend it being happy and doing what is productive and what matters with the people closest to you. And I think all the great ness in life comes from, uh, all the great outcomes and left come from compound interest, whether it's an investing, whether it's in relationships. So like my most popular tweet of all time is this one that kind of glib, but it says, uh, if you can't see yourself working with somebody for life, don't work with them for a day.

Now, of course, you're not going to like say, no, I'm not going to work with you because I'm not working with you for the rest of my life. But it's a good reminder that if you, that, if any relationship is short-term or temporary, it's really not going to pay out the dividends that you want later in life.

Um, so it's better to just. Treat a lot of your time as a search function where you're searching for through the set of jobs, you're searching through the set of dates and spouses. You're searching through the set of friends. You're searching through the set of hobbies until you find things you love. And when you find things in people that you love, you go all in on them.

So when you find the person that you love being around 24 7, and if they're attractive and of the opposite sex, you marry them. Um, if there's, uh, you know, friends that you just never get tired of hanging around with all those are going to be the three, four or five friends that you spend most your rest of your life with.

Um, hopefully they're happy people cause it'll rub off on you. There's a theory called the five chimps theory. You can and zoology, you can, uh, predict the mood behavior patterns of any Chimp by which five chimps they hang out the most with. So choose your five chimps carefully. Um, so I would say yes, people can get offended and they can damage relationships if you blow them off, or if you're non-responsive, but you have very little room in your life, longterm for real relationships.

So, so guard that time and it's really, it's actually really important to have empty space. If you don't have a day or two days, week in your calendar where you're not always in meetings and you're not always busy, then you're not gonna be able to think you're not able to have good ideas for your business.

You're not able to have good judgements. So I also encourage taking us at least one day a week, preferably two, because if you budget two, you'll end up with one, uh, a day, a week where you have nothing on your calendar and you just have time to think. Um, it's only after you're a board that you're going to have the great idea.

Uh, it's never going to be when you're stressed or, uh, busy or running around or rushed. Um, so make the time, same way with people. You need to have space in your life where you're not booked with the people that you already know. So this way, once in a blue moon, an invitation will come along and a person will come into your life.

That's suddenly really interesting and now you'll be able to make the time for them. So I think you have to be pretty ruthless about saying no to things about turning people down and living room in your life for serendipity. And in my experience, normally, if you don't make time for people when they're requesting time for you, yes, it's a little painful.

It's a little socially awkward, but the people aren't going to disrespect you, if anything, they want to hang out with even more, because they realize you're very discriminating with retirement. Um, but guide your time, forget the money. I mean, money is actually the least important thing that the discount rate to money.

Uh, I like asking my friends. Okay. If you could keep your friends and family and you keep everything, you know, but you lost all your money and your job and you had to start over, but in exchange, you get to be younger. You get to be physically younger. How many years of your life would you have to get back in exchange for giving up everything that you've earned and put away.

And I have friends who say, you know, five years or 10 years for me personally, it's about two to three years. I'd start over with everything. He gave me back two or three years of youth, uh, frankly, but the older you get, the smaller, that number gets when you're on your death bed. When you're in your last day, as you'd give up every dollar, the bank for another week, another few days, another hour, another minute.

So money has a very steep discount rate as you get older and you just realize you get older, that it matters less and less and less. Of course I've had the bare necessities, um, which, you know, unfortunately most of the world is still struggling with, uh, but the fact that you can probably listen to this podcast on, on an iPhone or whatever, you're listening to it on, uh, means you're already better off than a lot of people.

So guard your time. It's all you have. AGV eight S what has been the best lesson that investing has taught you? What investing has taught me is humility. It has taught me that nobody knows. I think so many companies are going to be great. So few actually work out. It shows how much luck there is involved in the system.

So it's important. Set up a system for yourself. Uh, Scott Adams actually has a great book on this. I think it's called how to fail, how to succeed without really trying or how to fail that everything has to succeed. I forget the exact name, but you can look it up. You can go to a blog that dilbert.com or just Google Scott Adams and look at his books, but he has a great book that talks about how you should have systems in life and you should look for patterns.

And that way you are not bound to any specific outcome. If you have a system, eventually given all the randomness in the world, the system will eventually pull signal out of the noise. It will overwhelm the randomness and let you get to your goal. Uh, but you have to have a system because the world is really random.

No individual investments going to work out, no individual. Person's going to be the perfect one. No individual situation is going to be a huge breakthrough. Um, in fact, uh, there's another great saying that I love which basically the brigade principle that says that a bad. Come suddenly, but good news takes time.

So the good things in your life develop slowly over time because you have systems and nets out there to catch them, but bad things like someone, you know, had a heart attack or you lost your, you know, the stock market crashed and lost a bunch of money. That kind of stuff tends to happen very, very suddenly.

So you just new patient not get too caught up. It's not the end of the world when something bad happens and you have a systems for good things, which systems and habits are actually very related. Um, I'm going to have to get off this podcast and give the pulpit back to Tim. So thank you all for listening.

Thank you for inviting me back in time. I hope it was useful and not just the, uh, you know, ramblings of, uh, of a strange person. Uh, and I hope to see you all on Twitter or otherwise, uh, good luck to everyone in their lives. I wish you happiness. I wish. I wish you consciousness so wish you fulfillment. Uh, I wish that this year you add a good habit.

Maybe you then break a bad habit. Um, and don't take anything too seriously. Thanks everyone.

Hey guys, this is Tim again, just a few more things before you take off. Number one. This is five bullet Friday. Do you want to get a short email from me? Would you enjoy getting a short email from me every Friday that provides a little more soul of fun before the weekend and five bullet Friday is a very short email where I share the coolest things I've found or that I've been pondering over the week.

That could include favorite new albums that I've discovered it could include gizmos and gadgets and all sorts of weird shit that I've somehow dug up in the, uh, the world of the esoteric as I do, it could include. Favorite articles that I've read and that I've shared with my close friends, for instance, and it's very short.

It's just a little tiny bite of goodness before you head off for the weekend. So if you want to receive that, check it out, just go to four-hour work week.com. That's four hour workweek.com all spelled out and just drop in your email and you will get the very next one. And if you sign up, I hope you enjoy it.

This episode is brought to you by athletic greens. I get asked all the time. If you could only use one supplement, what would it be? My answer is inhibited. Athletic greens.
