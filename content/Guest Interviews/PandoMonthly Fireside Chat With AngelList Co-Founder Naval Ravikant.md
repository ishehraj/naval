how many VCs act really nice to you, but like kind of the second you leave the room or kind of like, like I have to say I was at the lobby a couple of weeks ago and you know, you're not supposed to say what happens to the lobby, so I can't divulge details or all that, but there was like a whole user-generated conversation basically about angel list and like, you know, here's a lot of angst.

Well, I wasn't invited to the lobby and I figured you'd give me a list two softballs before we can launch right into it. Uh,

it's funny, generally, I would say most VCs who are on angel list and almost every VC firm has a partner who is tech savvy or an associate or two, I would hope every VC firm would have a tech savvy person. You'd be surprised. There are definitely VCs who are not comfortable using LinkedIn or Twitter and so on.

And for that crowd, you know, this is not sport who don't really use Facebook. Yeah. I'm not going to name them, but generally if they're tech savvy VC firms they'll have one or two people on it. Um, we'll usually have a very good relationship with those people. In fact, uh, we have, uh, sort of like their embedded journalists who go to war.

Um, we have embedded associates from a bunch of VC firms who dropped by every Tuesday morning and help us go through the queue and look at all the deals in the pipeline and so on. Yeah. So, and we welcome more of them. So it's kind of an open book. We're not trying to hold anything back for ourselves. And, uh, you know, my dream is someday I'll delete my admin account and angel list and we'll just work, but we're, we're a long ways from that.

So, uh, generally with most VCs is a very positive relationship. I think there's definitely ones who used to be king of the Hills and their little niche or their little town or their little venue, right. And by commoditizing and opening up the deal flow and the visibility and making more transparent, um, they've lost some of their information advantage.

Um, but the, uh, you know, Michael Lewis says the internet hates middlemen who rely on proprietary access to information to make a living. And so to the extent that they were relying on an information advantage, that's gone away. Uh, but, uh, what I find is that top, top tier VCs actually like us the best, which I was surprised about as much as anyone, but if you talk to the Greylock's and sequoias of the world, they're their viewpoints.

You're creating more and more deal flow for us. And we're sort of a bottleneck at our part of the chin. There's not that many top tier series, a series B funds. And so they get to see even more things, um, and it helps them more efficiently look at more things. So they're pretty happy about it. We're going to get more into this in a minute because I think the whole topic of deal flow and how it's changing in the valley is just fascinating.

And you know, you guys are, are a part of that. Um, but I want to talk about your journey and how you got here. Cause I know, you know, we all know the story of like Marc Andreessen met with mark Zuckerberg and Zach was like, tell me what was Netscape. I mean, kids who come to the valley are notorious for restorative, not having a lot of institutional memory and angel list is such an important thing for entrepreneurs arriving here now.

But I, I doubt they know much of your story at all. Yeah. It's not terribly interesting. I mean, what do you want me to start?

Yeah. Were you born? Yes. There, your mother linked this at one point. Um, how did you wind up in Silicon valley? And did you, were you interested in tech? Were you interested in entrepreneur? Uh, I, I fell in love with computers very early on, uh, actually McIntosh thus far before it was fashionable. Um, I think like most people in the audience who are engineers or hackers, I started out trying to crack games.

Um, but this is back in the day when you were opening up the back of a magazine and typing in a basic program for most of your games. And then in some cases you'd have a cassette tape or an all flash. Um, and you basically have to break into the game and pirated copied from your friend. And so it was the hacker mentality that got me into computers.

And then, uh, when I was in college, I was doing SIA. Well, I actually started out doing English and history, and then I don't want to drive a cab or these days, these days we'll be an Uber. Uber driver probably makes more than most people in this audience right now. But, um, but, uh, then I started studying computer science and physics and econ sort of going more hardcore.

And I read this great book called the Macintosh way, uh, which was written by guy Kawasaki. And it was about the secret project inside apple computer that led to the birth of the Macintosh. It was just such an inspirational book. So in my mind, Cupertino was this place with like flying castles and unicorns.

And it was pretty disappointing when I saw the real Cupertino strip malls. So I felt the same. I moved here in 99, which was even more, you know, and I, and I, yeah, and I flew into San Jose, which they were like, this is the capital of Silicon valley. And I really was expecting the Jetsons and I, you know, and then they pulled up and like, there wasn't even like a ramp, like a jet way to the airport.

Like you had to walk off the steps and like, oh, it's like, are we in the right San Jose? So, so I literally showed up in Silicon valley in 96, um, wanting to work here, I'd actually gone to out of school at the time coming out there weren't many exits, right. Especially in 1995. So I went to Dartmouth, did see us in econ.

Um, couldn't hack it in physics too hard. Um, and then, uh, Got out of Dartmouth and there are only a few exits, there was investment banking, there was grad school, there was consulting, there was no tech recruiting going on at the time. Uh, so I joined, uh, Boston consulting group, uh, quit almost immediately. I think it was during associate training that I, the first two weeks that I made up my mind to leave, I really wanted to be a tech industry.

And I thought what they were going to do was technology. But at the time, uh, they didn't, they were consulting for people like NYNEX, which was a predecessor to, uh, phone companies and, uh, uh, at and T as a hardware division, which became loosen technologies. Uh, and so it really wasn't high tech. And I remember having the hijack, the fax line to get a dial up connection to the internet, and it was just frustrating.

So I decided I had to come out to Silicon valley. Um, so I actually ended up consulting back to BCG as their internet guy, uh, got a job out here with at-home network, which became excited home, um, came out and, uh, just got into it. And Silicon valley scene was amazing, never looked back and I'm surrounded by great people.

Great tech, um, did a bunch of companies and efforts along the way, some successful, some fail. Uh, you know, one of the things I don't like about this whole culture here is what makes Silicon valley great is it's a meritocracy. And I almost feel like a schmuck sitting up here talking to you. Cause I think you guys have just as many interesting things to say back to me and I failed more than I've succeeded and, uh, everyone's journey is unique and interesting, and that is a meritocracy.

And you know, there's a lot of luck involved too. And some people win and they get to sit up on the stage and talk about how their photo uploading app got sold for a billion dollars. And yours went out of business, right? Yeah. And he did an amazing job and he did incredible, really hard things and not to take away anything from him, but there were a dozen guys who came before him who did incredibly hard things in same space whose timing was just pre iPhone.

And they're a dozen people who come later and do innovations because their posts Instagram, they don't, they don't get that same outcome. Um, so timing matters an enormous amount who you work with, if you were PayPal in the early days and ended up in the PayPal mafia, you did incredibly well. Um, so there's a lot of luck involved in the whole.

Yeah. How do you feel about that whole where luck ends and begins and where sort of skill ends and begins? I mean, I think this is something that people have a lot of angst over in the valley and I think they've, they banks if they failed, but they have more asked if they've succeeded. Success doesn't bring that much.

Chang's that sounds like something successful. People say it to, to make it sound like their lives are hard. Um, yeah, I mean, to be fair, you know, people have sold their company for a lot of money and then they go into this pit of depression and like, look, you can not feel sorry for them all you want, but it's a very real, they need to be slapped upside the head.

I mean, that's just idiotic. Uh, there is no question that you are better off than you were before you sold the company for a second. You were in an optimal situation. And if you don't believe that, then give your money away to somebody else. I think that's just kind of, I reject those things, that those viewpoints that fly in the face of common sense.

So, um, we're, we are here to succeed and if you succeed, you have won and it's great and you should enjoy it. And if it makes you more miserable than there's something deeply, deeply wrong with you.

So what is, when you say you are here to succeed, what do you mean by that? It's about money. What is, what is the goal money for? A lot of people ends up being a scorecard. Yeah. For example, you can get into one of these kinds of gatherings. And let's say that I've been in, I was at an event before speaking at Berkeley and there were about 300 people in the room and a lot of them we're mentors and entrepreneurs and investors, and some very successful people.

And I said, you know, how many of you in this room have started a company? I mean, a lot of hands go up, right? And then how many of you have sold the company? And some of the hands go down? How many of you had, you know, sold it? And it was a profitable outcome. You made some money, some more hands go down. Uh, how many of you built a product that was unique and new?

So you weren't just doing something, a variation what already existed, but it was generally, you know, more hands go down. Uh, and how many of you managed to actually sell that product to customers, to end users and get them to pay for it more hands go down in volume, nobody. Right. So the reality is that the history of Silicon valley is maybe every decade, 20 or 30 new great products that created and the rest of us right off their cocktails, including me for most of my career.

And so we kind of get lucky and we sell our companies to them, or we get unlucky and we don't, um, or, or we invest in them or we get a job around those companies that are going to write their IP or whatever it is. But the set of actual things that are truly created is very small. And that is the ultimate goal.

I think that's why people look up to Elon Musk and Steve jobs and mark Zuckerberg. They've managed to create something brand new that did not exist before and spread it to the world in volume and get paid for it. So it's very, very, very hard thing. Is there anyone who you think is doing that now? Who doesn't get credit for it?

If you, if you had to bet who's like a year old or so, or maybe two years older, we'll be looking back and saying that about, you know, it's a tough one. I don't, if I knew I'd be out there trying to invest in them, I guess. Uh, I think there's probably a lot of entrepreneurs doing that. Um, the question is, does that get paid in volume part?

Um, there's no question. There are people building amazing, amazing things. Um, and there's some really good technology and good products being built, but I don't want to single out particular people that I think are doing incredibly well. Like, uh, you know, there's some things that are like life check Uber is a life-changing experience when you try it.

You're just like, holy cow. That was so great. Everything should work like that. And in fact, I think every vehicle that has a commercial license plate will be Uber eyes in some form or another, whether it's your commercial license, but yeah, print planes should certainly be, you should know when your planes are arriving at the gate, actually arriving as opposed to when the airline tells you it's arriving.

Um, you should know when the firetruck or the ambulance is on its way, the fire trucks behind you to show up on your GPS. Um, if you're locked out and you call locksmith, you should know how far away that locksmith is. If you're a, you should, the, the idea that you have to sit at home in an eight hour window and wait for the cable guys.

Right. It's just nonsense or where's the ups person who comes and rings the doorbell while you're in the bathroom. Ah, right. That just shouldn't happen. So in that sense, Uber is a, is one of those technologies because it just shows you what's possible. Um, and I'm a big fan of all the other things around that space that are like that.

So one that I would point out is Postmates, but disclaimer, I'm an investor. Um, but that's how I know the company. Um, but they're doing the, get it now app where the Uber has couriers. So you order from a restaurant or from your, or you want flowers picked up or your dry cleaning and uh, you'll see the courier on a map.

So you'll know when they're going to get, pick up the item and come back to you. Um, so I think there thanks to the iPhone. There is a lot of that going on. Now there's a computer in everyone's pocket. It's with you all the time. You're constantly, constantly using. Um, in fact, like, you know, I, it's just insane how much time I've spent in my iPhone.

And I'm sure it's probably true for most of you, the Android phone or your iPhone. And it's just, life-changing the surprise for me with the iPhone is, um, cause I'm still one of the people who I miss the physical keyboard and like I miss the ease of doing emails and, you know, I don't think it is the Jesus phone, but th the amazing thing for me is like, like you are going to die.

I love the touchscreen. There was a, but coming there, but I have one because I have to like function and use new technology. And I am stunned that, you know, usually on Saturdays, I try to, you know, mostly not work and it's kind of the one day I try to spend time with my kid. And I mean, I will be totally informed actually at quite a bit of work done, but like some days not opened my laptop for a day or two.

And for someone who writes for a living like a device without a keyboard, like that's pretty stunning. Yeah. I think, uh, almost all usage is going to go to mobile devices and tablets and the like, uh, for there are large swats of humanity who are growing up connected to the internet, but, um, have never owned a desktop or laptop computer never will.

And nor did they need to. Um, so it's interesting what you said about Postmates. You know, a lot of people see that who were here in the nineties and they're like, oh, it's just like Cosmo. And, you know, I know Andreessen and some others have said basically every business idea that came out in the 1990s was totally a viable idea.

It was just done too early. Yeah. Are you a believer on that? There's a lot of truth to that. Uh, for example, I did a business called Epinions back in 1999, which did reasonably well and went public as part of shopping.com, but it wasn't the gang Buster blow out that Yelp is. Um, but the reason it couldn't have been Yelp is because of the time not enough local businesses were online and there was not enough density of users online that you could get them to review the local businesses.

So all the pieces were not in place. It was just a lot harder to do something back then to give you an idea where the opinions are first round raised 8 million bucks. Um, it took us six months to ship our website. We had to buy our servers. They weren't our data centers, those were brand new. So we had to host our servers ourselves in our office.

We had to get a T1 connection, which is a very expensive, uh, internet connection to, to host out to the internet. We wrote our own deployment scripts with the bison servers. We had to buy Oracle databases. No, my SQL there was no get that, none of that. So everything was just really, really, really hard and took a long time.

And then the addressable user base was a hundred than what it is today. Um, so just because of network effects and critical mass effects, a lot of businesses couldn't work. Uh, even social networking is not a new idea before Facebook, of course is my space. And before that it was Friendster. But before that you go to Korea and there were dozens of social networks there, including the very famous Cyworld that predated by years.

But you needed a high enough density of your friends on the internet that when you send out that, uh, almost retarded sounding, I'm your friend or you my friend email. Yeah, exactly. The playground emails. I can get my friend right before you send out that email, you don't recommend it. It's a little weird.

So yeah, it's a little creepy. Yeah. 1999, just not enough of your friends were online, that you would get an answer and get critical mass. The timing is very important. I'm curious your thoughts on path. Cause I was talking to someone about this the other day. I feel like I was one of those people who totally like bought what, what path was selling when they first came out and thought, you know, yes, I would love away.

I think I was pregnant at the time. And it was like, you know, I, I'm not, I don't want to be with people who like shoves baby pictures all over Facebook, but like there are people in my life who would want to see every single baby picture. And I loved the idea of a really well-designed social network for friends and families and practice path is in no way than that.

For me, it is a smaller subset of the people that I interact with on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram. And it basically has no value. I'm curious, is that an example? I mean, for me, I'm sorry. I, you know, is that an example of something that, where the adoption curve isn't quite there yet? It's really hard to say.

I think that goes back to the earlier point about how much of it is timing and luck and you may think everything is right at the intellectual level. Uh, but the reality is it just doesn't work in the market yet or, and so working in a different way than you anticipate. Um, I don't think Twitter turned out to be what people thought it would be.

Uh that's Evan and Jack. No, it was, it was originally a microblogging platform and it actually started out more about friends tweeting each other about what they were up to. Um, and then from there it sort of shifted more towards a celebrity-driven broadcast mechanism. And now I feel like it's, at least for me, it's replaced television and newspapers, um, or at least the information news dissemination part of television newspapers, along with some weird friend stuff mixed in, but it's its own unique thing.

Yeah, I think so. It's just very hard to tell what these things are gonna turn out to be, uh, it's possible paths may turn out to be something completely different. What is Foursquare today? Right? It seems to be morphing more towards a Yelp type thing where you might've originally imagined that it was more about tracking your friends locations.

Yeah. It is more about like discovering things around where you are versus where are my friends now? Um, so let's get back to your story. So you brought up Epinions, which was a very controversial company. Um, I mean, okay. I was reading, I was doing like, I was looking back through the, you know, the novel, um, you know, history of, of clips on the internet.

And, you know, there was this massive scandal about you suing your VCs. And I was reading this wall street journal article that said, this is going to change Silicon valley forever. Cause everyone's been too scared to Sue VCs before, and he is, he's utterly changed it. Now everyone's going to go ape shit, suing VCs, which didn't exactly happen.

Um, but I am under nondisclosure as part of the, uh, find out anything about your ballsy suing investment. There's legally bound. I mean, it's all in the public record, so you can go look it up. Do you, are you surprised that people didn't start suing VCs left and right. It's a very difficult thing to do, and you have to be very certain

was there let's, let's just say it did lead to the birth of venture hacks, which is what led to the birth of angel list. Because after that, I was determined that, uh, I sort of became the go-to guy in understanding how to negotiate a term sheet, because now I was very cognizant of what goes into a term sheet and wine.

And, uh, back then every term sheet used to be customed. And they used to give a lot of power to the investors where it's actually today, especially coming out of NICU, but all those convertible notes and so on, give a lot of power to the entrepreneur, but entrepreneurs take that for granted. It didn't used to be the case.

So with venture hacks were really blogged the game theory of venture capital and how to negotiate a term sheet. Um, but these days, the term sheet is so standardized and they've gotten either more balanced or more entrepreneur friendly, um, that it's no longer an issue, but angel is probably wouldn't be here today if it weren't for that history.

Hm. So let's talk about, we, we, we don't have to go back to the birth of opinions and you won't tell us about the juices are for people who don't know, you can look it up, but essentially as I understand it and feel free to jump in, um, they, uh, opinions was sold to shopping.com and there was a lawsuit because a lot of the early three of the early founders said that, uh, basically they were tricked out of, um, signing their shares back over to the company and very powerful investors like benchmark capital were sued.

Did that. Is there still bad blood. There is a part of people's hackles about it. I think there are still people that I would not do business with and wouldn't do business with me, but it's a very small set. So tell us about venture hacks. How exactly did that, did that lead to it? Was it, yeah, people coming to me and asking for advice on, Hey, what does this term, the term sheet should I care about or not?

Uh, and so much of it, it was a black art. I mean, keep in mind a venture investor, a venture firm probably puts out 10 or 20 term sheets a year. They have institutional memory because there are long-term players for decades in the industry. Um, whereas you're coming in negotiating your first term sheet, which is the most important one.

You don't know anything you can easily get taken advantage of, uh, especially with an less reputable firm. Uh, and you don't have anyone on your side, even your lawyers, uh, like the usual, uh, Silicon valley lawyers get a lot more of their business from the VCs and the do from you. Um, and there's just a standard way of doing things.

Uh, and you have to know what's negotiable. What's not, what's important. What's not, um, and what, where you have leverage and where you don't. So that's why venture hacks, what were some of the ways people were taking advantage of back then? Uh, well, I mean, there, there are quite a few of them. One is the different kinds of liquidation preference.

So, uh, liquidation preferences, the investors get paid back before you can make any money as a common shareholder. Uh, but there were, it was actually not uncommon for term sheets to have multiples or cases where they would get paid back and they would get a piece of the upside, um, uh, anti dilution. So how do you handle down rounds, board control?

Who can fire you? What happens in your vesting? Um, all those kinds of things. It, it, it was very common. It still happens, unfortunately, where, uh, very often that entrepreneurial get pushed out of their own company. The investor will bring in, um, uh, someone who's like a friendly CEO. The next thing, you know, the company runs out of cash, the investors to recap it it's a down round and then they own end up owning all the equity risk of that happening today.

Um, there's a lot of companies that, you know, we're all in this billion dollar club, fairly recently pre Facebook's IPO. Um, there hasn't yet been a lot of recaps, but a lot of companies are in these interesting positions. When we saw Spotify this week, they'd raised a billion, which a lot of people thought was very heady.

They've now raised it 3 billion, right? You know, they avoided the down round then, but are they going to a lot of concerns with square, like a company that sells a lot of execution risk? Yeah, it can absolutely still happen, but I think today it's actually more likely it almost happened the other direction, uh, where a lot of times founders have inordinate voting control.

Um, or, uh, if you look at some of these notes that companies, uh, get their investors sign up to when they come out of incubator, some of these notes are, are pretty entrepreneurial friendly, surprisingly. So, um, so now it's just business it's contract negotiations, and I think, uh, you could see either side, uh, causing trouble, but generally terms are much, much, much more standardized.

Um, this is one of the things that allowed us to launch Angeles darks, where we do the, um, free series seed and, uh, and convertible note closings online, actually Ben Mathis with built it is sitting right there say hi. Um, so yeah, so basically term sheets are supposed to be this black art. They're supposed to be incredibly complicated.

No one on earth can figure them out. You need expensive lawyers to spend $20,000 per law firm, and they have to spend a month negotiating this document that's closing, but thousands of companies have done it and hundreds do it every month. So how can it be something that has not been standardized by now?

Um, and, uh, the good news, it is starting to get very standardized. So we took the series seed doc said Ted way. Put together and that are used for a large chunk of financings today. Um, and for example, I think Andreessen Horowitz, uh, signed off on him and is willing to use them. Um, and we basically just built a workflow around those, uh, you know, check boxes, electronic signatures, Dropbox, and fill out the form fields.

And then we generate the legal, these put out the PDFs follow with the, with, uh, Delaware and all that stuff. Um, there's no rocket science or magic to it. It's just somebody had to tackle it. So these things are getting more and more standardized. Okay. And you think that's a permanent shift as a permanent shift shift?

Uh, when you buy shares in a company on the stock market, you don't sweat the details about what the paper's underneath. You don't think about all the ways you can get ticketed advantage of, um, you do maybe with the pink sheets or somewhere where there's like strange stuff going on. Um, but generally you're assured that if you buy Microsoft stock and you own, you know, thousands of a percent of Microsoft or whatever it is that it has that economic value associated with it, and you're not going to wake up tomorrow morning and find out that Steve bomber somehow taking your shares away from you.

Um, so you shouldn't have that fear of the private markets either neither side should, and it should be well established contracts and norms and a balanced contract law. How much of this was, um, VCs trying to take advantage of entrepreneurs and how much of this was. You know, look at some point, they're going to have power again in the ecosystem.

And we got to push back while we have power now. And this is just the way the game is played. Yeah. I don't, I don't think any VC sits around smoking a cigar saying I've got to go grab power in the ecosystem. I think, uh, I wish they did. Yeah. They don't smoke around thing. Right. Um, but I think it's just more about, uh, we're negotiating a deal.

Contracts are negotiated for the worst case. Not for the best case. Uh, things could go wrong. If things go wrong, I trust me more than I trust you. So let me just make sure that we do it my way. I think it's that simple. And I think the entrepreneurs will do it back to the VCs if they have the opportunity.

So I don't think it's a fairness thing. I think it's, at the end of the day, it just boils down to unfortunately, a power thing, which is by the way, what game theory teaches you? Most of it boils down to power. There is no concept of fairness. Um, so you just have to make sure that you don't get taken advantage of in a situation, um, where you have some power, you exercise it to get a fair outcome, or if you don't have power, you're at least aware of it.

So you know what the consequences could be. So what do you think about people who feel like entrepreneurs are pushing it too far now? I mean, even, you know, Paul Graham did a post essentially saying, you know, sort of, you know, remember you're, you're building long-term relationships. Yeah, I think there are definitely entrepreneurs who do push it too far.

Um, there are, uh, I actually think the rise of uncapped notes is one example of that. Um, I've joked internally with people that, uh, next up is uncapped Motivity exit, right. And get 15% back, 15% bonus of the exit. And that's it. That's your entire return? Um, largely uncapped notes tend to be non economic for the investors.

Um, and similarly I've seen, uh, situations where an investor who's sort of trusting an entrepreneurial will sign a document that says, Hey, uh, you know, you're going to convert at a 6 million pre or whatever until the next into the next round. It's a spending cap. But if we sell the company for a gazillion dollars, uh, you just get your money back, like, you know, so there there's all these little twists and loopholes you've got to watch out for, which is another reason why it's good just to put these things online, standardized them, and then have, uh, one set of docs where you can say, I've read this, I agree with this.

Okay. And I'd have to touch it again. I don't have to think about it again. And next time the doc shop, I know it's the same docs. And if there's a change, you can call that out. But, uh, you know, just make it very standardized. Right. Um, but what is, what would you recommend to young entrepreneurs who are in the room raising money?

Should they, if they have a hot company people want to get into, should they try to push it as far as they possibly can. Uh, no, because money has karma too. And if you treat it badly, it will treat you badly. The wheel kind of always comes around. I feel. Um, so I think you have to be balanced about it, but if you have a strong hand, then you do deserve a strong outcome.

Uh, the problem is everything is contextual. It's very hard to sit up here and say, all of us do X, right? Um, by the way, that's what keeps these interviews interesting. If there was a one set of right answers, your first guest would answer them all. And this place would be a ghost town, but every, everything is contextual.

And, uh, I do think that you want to leave something on the table. Uh, like a good rule of thumb in negotiations is, you know, negotiate hard, get what's get what you're fairly doing at the end, give something back, um, because you have to work together for the longterm. Uh, I actually now firmly believe that, uh, everything you do in life, uh, all the returns in life come from compound interest.

Uh, it come from the length and strength of your relationship. Look at the PayPal mafia and how they just keep compounding into new companies that they do together. Similarly in your marriage or relationship, the longer you hold out, the better it gets, right? The better you survive. Uh, Warren buffet is the richest guy on the planet, uh, or the legally, the richest guy on the planet.

There's a lot of illegal wealth out there too, because he never spends a dollar. He just reinvested, it just keeps compounding it and he holds it. Um, so the same way, your best business relationships are going to be with the people that you end up working with for decades. Um, and that is true of your investors too.

Um, so if you treat them well and always try and make them money, and if you don't make them money, at least they don't feel like you overreached. Um, you will keep that relationship for a long, long time. Uh, one of the things that I'm not very wary of is people who are over optimizing for the moment, because they're signaling, they're not a long-term player.

If they're not a long-term player, you don't want establish a relationship with them. You see a lot of that time. Uh, Silicon valley is now back into the phase. It was in 1999, maybe not as frothy, but that it is a magnet town. So it's pulling a lot of people in from the outside. And, uh, back to game theory for a second, a lot of virtue comes from the iterated prisoner's dilemma, if you will, which is you're going to be playing that same game with these people over and over and over.

So it's in your benefit to cooperate because you know, you'll play with them. But when a new person comes in and the rewards can be huge, you can make 20 million, 50 million and win and leave. The temptation is to cheat it's to kind of go for the goal. Yeah. Or some people would call hack or hack. Uh, but it's not a good kind of hack.

Um, and, and there's a lot more of those people in the ecosystem, right. Are they coming in at the entrepreneur level angel level? All of the above. Yeah. Every level, every level it's just, whenever someone comes in as a newcomer, what you have to basically decide is, is this someone that I'm going to know a decade from now, is this someone I'm going to be doing business with a decade from now?

Um, and if not, uh, then you have to be wary of how can you tell if someone is, has the wrong motives? Okay. How do you know if that's, when you're not going to do business with a decade from now, one is, do you like them? If you don't like them as humans, you, you're not going to associate yourself with them a decade from now.

Um, second one is, do you trust them? And you have to pick that up in little ways, because you won't really know until the money hits the table. That's when you see what everyone is actually made of. Um, but uh, you want to try and assess them in little ways, uh, references obviously matter. Uh, and you want to see how considered and considerate they are about.

Uh, I've definitely as an investor, I've dropped out of investments because I felt the founder was over optimizing and in the, in the grand scheme of things, it was not a big deal. Like the economics were almost the same, but the fact that they were fighting for this tiny, tiny little piece has told me that that's, they're, they're overreaching.

They're going for too much right now. How frequently in the valley do you think people with the wrong interests when, probably more than half the time. And so does that, does that bother you or you just, if you leave that money on the table, fine. Yeah. You can't let it because here's so most of the time, times that you do good work and you do good things and you do it the right way, you will lose for most of the time, you, you will do good things and you will lose.

And that's just the nature of the beast. It's a very efficient market. There's a lot of luck. There's a lot of competition. Uh, and, uh, you might, first time you do a company it'll probably fail. And the second time you do it, you probably do with the wrong people. And the third time you do it, you probably get taken advantage of, so you go through these learning curves, but you only have to get it right once that's the good news.

The outcome is usually so good in a binary sense when you get it right, but you just have to get it right once. And what's the risk. I mean, these days people are writing checks. You're still getting paid. You're living in one of the best cities in the world. You're drinking great coffee. You're, you know, hanging out at a great bar.

You're going to great restaurants. And it's considered glamorous. I mean, we're no longer in a time where if you are a cocktail party and someone asks what you do for a living and you say, you know, oh, I don't really work. I'm trying to start a company. Like that's no longer, you know, this guy's a total weird.

Yeah. I kind of don't like that. Actually. I wish it was more that underdog mentality. You and me both, but you're the one enabling all of it,

I would think. So you are enabling more people, more people, entrepreneurs. So is that of itself a thing? I think there's an unequivocally good thing. Um, what I don't think is necessarily good as for more companies to be funded. I don't want companies that are unfundable to get funded. I think that is a bad outcome for everyone, because there are a lot of great businesses that can be built without funding, but the moment you add funding, it ruins them because now you have these high expectations and let them do stupid things to generate a return for their investors.

Um, so you definitely don't want that, but, uh, I do think that more startups are a good thing to me. Startups is a small companies and more creativity. Uh, and so you lump into that lifestyle businesses. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. I th you know, the lifestyle business thing. It's a little bit of a put down that comes more from the investor side.

Uh, but the reality is I think we would all love to have great lifestyle businesses, right? It's something we're passionate about. Something we work on. We set our own hours, right? Control of our own life. No one else, no one else. Your boss, you can keep the profits and you don't have to, uh, stay up nights and, or throw up in the shower.

Cause he trying to figure out to turn into a billion dollar business and you have convinced everyone around you is going to be a billion dollar business, but you yourself are not convinced. Right. So then don't tell me you haven't had that moment. Maybe that's showing up to the shower in the shower a couple of months ago.

I think it was because I'm pregnant, but, uh, but I'm sure, you know, look, you have investors, you told a story. Yep. How do you feel about the story being a $20 a ticket? And I think

Hoffman gets how many pennies back the ticket price is. We absolutely lose money on this long term that, um, no, look, I, I have so much appreciation for sort of everything. Every entrepreneur I've ever written about has gone through after doing this for 10 minutes. I frankly, I'm not one of these people who ever go around saying I just loved the early days of a company.

I never want to do this again. I hope I am running this company for the rest of my career. I never want to do what I did for the last 10 months, the last company, partially because I love it so much. I want to do it forever and partially because I don't have another one in me. Well, thank God for you. And everyone else has disrupted the industry.

You know, the thing that actually disrupted the industry was not us. And, uh, and I give YC, for example, a lot of credit for pioneering, the incubator, the new incubator. Um, but it wasn't them either. Um, the thing that disrupted the industry was just the cost of building a business has collapsed and that has changed.

And so, uh, like I said before, we had our sun servers and our Oracle databases. And now you have AWS and you want to market, uh, you want to acquire customers and you use Google. You want to do customer service, you do that on Twitter. You want to market use Facebook. Um, you want to, uh, you know, host it's on Heroku.

Um, you need some part-time labor it's Elancer Lancer, oDesk. You need your site cleaned up. That's mechanical Turk. Um, you want money? It's Kickstarter arranger list. So they're just, or they're angel investors. So there's just so much embedded leverage in the system. Now that a single person with a lever can truly move the earth.

It was impossible. Um, I think, I think the venture community, for example, likes to treat Instagram as an aberration. They like to say, oh yeah, Instagram. Well, don't worry about that. The rest of you are still going to need a hundred million bucks from us, but I don't think that's true. I think we're going to see a lot more Instagrams.

Uh, there was actually a specific point of disagreement I had with mark in recent, since you want me to be controversial, you know, Mark's counterpoint to this would be that Instagram didn't monetize, but I think they couldn't monetize find with five people, five additional people they don't need. And there's nothing about Instagram that needs 200 people.

Um, so I think we're gonna see more and more and more great businesses built, um, that are essentially built entirely through leverage, uh, that are communicating to the world through API APIs, uh, and just have very, very, very little head count. So they just need very little capital and because they need so little capital, everything.

The entire ecosystem changes the entire nature of the venture industry and the relationship to the entrepreneur changes. And it also changes the biggest pain point that entrepreneurs have right now, which is talent. That's right. Talent is the biggest pain point at the moment. Um, it actually makes it a lot harder because people can go start their own company.

So if you don't have product market fit also in Andreessen's words, why should they come work for you? Why shouldn't they just start their own company or go into incubator? Certainly if they have a good idea and they have the risk profile and they feel like they're ready, that's, that's your opportunity costs.

Um, so the days when you could, before product market fit, you'd raise a million bucks and you'd hire your first engineer, give him a quarter point that those days are over. Um, if you don't have product market fit, these people are just late founders and you have to treat them as such. So it makes it a lot, lot harder to hire.

Um, it also means that the entire venture capital community has gone through a massive shift in the last three years, which I don't think most of them are aware of. Um, you know, I think, uh, many of them are aware that things are changing, but I don't think they understand what a deep level they're changing at.

Um, to give you one example, sand hill road became the center of the tech universe because that is the place you used to go to for your first check. Um, it was the first credible money in, uh, who took a board seat and had influence over the car. Um, but that position and power moved away from them in 2007 and started moving toward the so-called super angels, the Chris soccers and the Dave McClure's and I was doing it for awhile.

Um, but now today, that first check privilege goes to the incubators. So excuse me, most companies don't go around calling themselves a Sequoia company, rather they are, uh, you know, YC back Dropbox, or they are, uh, Techstars back tore, but right. So they're, they're marketing themselves in a different way. Um, or, you know, it's, uh, angel paired back MoPub.

So these companies are taking their brand and their advice and their first check, the first people who believe in them are doing it with $25,000, $15,000, not with $3 million. And so that puts the venture capital industry on a further back section of the theater. Um, which is dangerous because the brands get built by establishing the early relationship with the entrepreneurs.

Um, and, uh, and so I think that's the, the lower amount of money that companies needs changes, everything, and that lower amount of money it's continuing on. I mean, yes, today, most of the seed rounds are seven 50 K or there a million, but there are a lot of companies that can get really far in 250 K you have two or three grid hackers, and you can prototype and test something for a couple of hundred K I mean, heck they do it in incubators for 25 K in three months.

That's the competition. Um, so, so that lowering cost of building a business is dislocating everything and everyone. So let's talk about the role. I want to sit with the role of the super angels, and I want to talk about the role of VC firms who try to compete with them and get lower and lower down.

Because look, I think evidence of what you're saying is how much VC firms have reinvented their, their model, um, you know, trying to do this. Um, but let's talk about the super angels first. Um, you know, I think a lot of these, you know, were frankly unsustainable and a lot of them, while they'll, they'll announce they've raised a new fund, you know, if you really talk to the LP community, they've raised it at much lower rates than what they were seeking.

And now everyone is very panicked about this series, a crunch that they see coming. And it's interesting, the people I hear freaking out about the series, a crunch or not the entrepreneurs, they're the super angel. I disagree. I think the super angels, the feds dependence returns, not all of them, really. You think in aggregate, at least the ones that I, it was investing alongside the Mike Maples, the Chris soccer's Mike Maples is a dramatic exception for many, even, even people like you don't think it's a style ratio that it is in venture capital where 95% of the returns are coming from five

So the class of 2007, 2008, when we were out investing in the average Fremont, he was between one and 3 million. Um, and VCs wouldn't touch it because it was just too early for them. And they didn't know how to rent a check for two, 300 K the returns from that class are pretty good. Now, if you go into 2010 and you're seeing prices of six to 10 million, same quality companies, more competitive, your returns have to go down.

Um, so I think the vintage matters a lot and super angel is a funny term. It's just, uh, uh, most super angels had funds. They just had small VC funds. They just took the angel branding. Um, and, but they're really fun. They're really VC funds. Um, so to me, the distinction at the end of the day is not drawn between, uh, whether you have other people's money or not.

It comes down to, are you willing to write a small check or you're willing to decide quickly? And most importantly, are you willing to forgo the normal control terms that a VC would have put on you back in 2007? So you say, okay, I don't need a board seat. I mean, the service business I'm going to help you and you tell me how I can help you.

Um, so. Uh, the, the super angels as a class, I think are almost setting up to be the next generation of the branded series. I mean, they're growing into that increasingly these guys, in order to avoid the series, they crutch are all doing seed extensions, which they didn't do before. And so if you look at the money they're putting to work in a company it's pretty similar to what series they used to be.

Yeah. The series a crunch, you could take two points of view on it. One is you could say, oh, there's not enough series a capital. Uh, but the reality is I think it's a little differently. I think that a lot of these companies are experiments and that's okay. There's nothing wrong with that. Um, they're cheap, low cost experiments, and they should be treated as such.

So if they fail there shouldn't be any egg on your face. You just go and start over and try again, look at all the YC companies that go back into YC. Um, so there's a, there's a recycling here. The problem is the prices have to reflect it. They have to reflect a hit rate of one at a five or one of 10 instead of the one out of three.

And I think early investors who may have had the wrong expectation that it's not an experiment. We'll try and push you into raising a seed Prine as we call it inside of angel list or raising a series a when it's premature. And all you're doing is you're trapping yourself. You're locking yourself in and to push like system.

Plus you're trying to push this rock up hill in this. Maybe there's no market there or you miss them. Um, and, or you don't have the right team. It's just almost impossible. Um, so you have to treat it like it's an experiment. The prices have to reflect that the amounts raised have to reflect that the attitudes have to reflect that in some sense, I feel bad for this generation of entrepreneurs, because back in my day, um, if you manage to raise that first few million bucks, the odds of you making it to the next round were one out of two or one out of three, because there just weren't that many companies that had raised 5 million bucks.

But today, if you raise a seed round, the odds of you making it into a series, they are closer to one in 10. So the odds are against you. You just have to be more comfortable with the idea of failure. So I think it's better if you're going to fail, fail fast, faced, or fail early acknowledged reality, and then try again.

And in general, I don't think startups do this in the valley. I mean, you look a lot of people, there's an obsession with finding someone, a software. Which means an Aqua hire, right? Why is your, why is the repercussion of your company did not have that product market fit? There was something you missed right now.

I'm going to go be an indentured service, serve it to Facebook for the next couple of years, with some members of my team so that we can all sort of save 50 cents on the dollar. I mean, that doesn't seem particularly healthy to here. Well, hires aren't really pushed by the investors, the investment, true.

The investors lose money in most of the see cases. Listen, I have talked to super angels as we call them who say the bulk of their time is spent calling around, trying to get these guys soft landings right now. Yeah. These are really hard. The set of companies that get soft landings is very small. Uh, I think it's, uh, it's overrated in the press because the PR, because if your company dies completely, you're not going to talk about it.

It's you're not gonna tell anyone about it. Um, but if you get the echo higher, then you get to save face and you'll trumpet up a bit. And so all the investors, so you'll hear about it. So there's just an evidence bias here, which is a reporting bias here. Uh, I think the demand for people trying to sell them is gone.

I will supply has dramatically increased, but the actual close transactions, I don't think has increased all that much. Um, not most companies do not get soft landings, even the ones who want them. Um, and I don't think it's so bad for the entrepreneurs in this study because you go hang out at Google for a year or two or three, and they pay really well.

Um, you know, they'll give you, and the acquirers are getting very smart about separating the investors from the talent. Um, so they'll give a big chunk in retention or not to the talent and the investors often lose money. Yeah. So I've heard recently that this is increasingly happening and that a lot of investors are pioneering, you know, terms to put into the term sheet, right.

Guaranteed to X or whatever. Right. But the reality is they can force it when it comes time for the actual acquisition, the acquire will say, well, we're only going to pay 10 cents on the dollar and take it or leave it. And if you leave it, your opportunity cost is. Um, so I, I absolutely, we are seeing investors put in multiples on acquisitions, um, so that they don't, uh, so that they make some return in these cases.

But the reality is they have no negotiating leverage. Hmm let's you brought up Y Combinator, w I'm curious to talk a little bit more about the impact. That's had. One thing that's fascinated me about the last few years is how many things were sort of pioneered. And again, you still have the same thing with companies as we just discussed, but the venture level, how many things were pioneered in the late nineties as new ways to form companies that did not do well.

And how many of them have now worked in this, in this iteration? You know, when it comes to crowdfunding, there's this horrible sort of Draper Fisher fund called me VC. That was a huge failure. Um, you know, there were definitely incubators that were huge failures. Um, there were a lot of firms who tried to do sort of what Andreessen Horowitz has been doing with the agency model.

There was the Kretser model of Kleiner Perkins, which now, um, first round is doing. I mean, it's funny how much you see these coming back, right. Um, I'm curious from your point of view, both with you guys and YC and let's take YC first. What, why did it work better this time? Uh, Y C worked for a number of reasons.

One is of course, Paul himself has incredible reach and, you know, amazing writer and an advisor. Um, so he just pulled in talent. Uh, he pulled in talent that was completely out of market at the time. If you were two young kids graduating out of MIT and you had done some great projects, you, you could not just go start a company.

It wasn't that easy. Um, so he provided them in a path into Silicon valley. Now, of course there are multiple paths, but at the time that was the only such path. Uh, and unlike the older models that were tried, like the ideal labs of the world, he didn't take 30 or 40% of your company. It wasn't his idea. Uh, he was taking a much smaller chunk.

He was basically saying, I'm going to be your early advisor slash angel, who will put you in business and really explain to you how things work and give you access. And for that, I'm going to get an, a very low valuation. Uh, but I'm going to take the most important part of the advice that you look for in an investor.

Um, and then you'll be able to make it up by getting a higher valuation from other people later. Um, so he really organized it, uh, in a, and I I'll give him credit for another thing too, which is he modeled it very much after the college model. Um, so the time period that you, these are, these were mostly for people coming straight out of college.

So the reading natural transition, and it was like, okay, uh, you're going to have, you know, a three month, like a semester type period. Um, you're going to have a project that you have to ship and show there's going to be weekly meetings and reviews. It's, we're not quite greeting you, but it's almost at that level, we're going to have office hours just like you did with your professor.

And then finally there'll be a demo day within the graduation, the alumni network. So it was a very nice templatize model. That's just overlaid onto the school model. Um, w H Y C is a lot like you guys in the fact that it's one of these things that VCs, extensively say they support, and then there's a lot of grousing about the impact on the ecosystem.

Um, is, do you think one of the issues that VCs have with YC is how much his economics are just completely different? I mean, he doesn't have to go fundraise every couple of years. He doesn't have to D he has some LPs, but he doesn't have to deal with them in the same way. Yeah. I mean, his economics are great if he finds, keeps finding an occasional Dropbox, uh, I mean, there doesn't need very many of them.

Yeah, no, that's right. I would, I would guess his economics are probably as good as marketing. Um, but without the $3 billion under management and having to deal with all the LPs. So in that sense, he's really hacked of the venture model, um, and, and created this incredible, uh, niche at the beginning. The irony is the rule of thumb in the VC business used to be that the more money you raise and the more money you invest, the more money you will make.

And YC turned that on its head and said with an absolute minimum amount of capital, we will have amazing economics. Uh, and it was a startup. They took huge risk and now they're getting paid for it. Yeah. Um, do you think it's sustainable in the same way that people feel like there's a level of arrogance there that people say it's over fish pond?

No, it's sustainable. As long as the good companies keep going there and they keep doing a good job with them. Uh, I do think that the other incubators have a lot to offer as well. Uh, so, you know, YC is a Harvard or Stanford. There will be MITs and there will be, um, you know, Caltech and so on. So, uh, they're starting to, uh, segregate, uh, incubators by geography, of course, accelerate in Chicago micro lab in LA, uh, 500 startups, global, uh, Techstars of course, Boston D but do you think any of these guys are in the same league as YC either in the halo effect, it gives you, uh, not yet the markups slash halo effect of getting that higher valuation and demo day, but in terms of sheer quality, I've been very impressed with some of them, uh, angel pad, which has kind of all the experts.

Um, smaller class, very high quality. Um, if you look at Lemnos and accelerator, they doing the hardware ones, they have very high quality and they're uniquely focused in hardware. Um, Techstars New York usually has some very strong companies, um, and you know, the others are more specialized or up and coming.

Um, there's a lot of good ones out there, so I don't think it gets to be just one size fits all forever. The interesting thing to me about incubators is, you know, to me, it's very easy to find capital and to find mentors in Silicon valley. I mean, particularly compared to probably anywhere else in the world.

Um, and yet, you know, Y Combinator is here. I mean, it would be easy to say Y Combinator would do a lot more value in places where that wasn't the case. Do you think incubators work outside of tech hubs that have some sort of critical mass it's much, much harder? Um, so, uh, the problem is that funding markets generally develop backwards.

Uh, people think like, oh, I'm going to create an incubator. And then, uh, when people graduate, well, who's going to fund them. It's got to be the angels. If there's no angel ecosystem, those companies fall flat on their face and die. And so, and then even if you have angels to invest in them, then you use series ABC to pick up the next part and the series B to pick up the next part and so on and so forth.

So what tends to happen is in a first, in a country, you have the public market get robust. And then after that, you'll have mezzanine investors come along, who will just cherry pick deals right before they go public. And then you have the late stage than the earlier stage. So YC had to move here from Cambridge because they couldn't have worked anywhere else.

It just wasn't enough of an angel ecosystem. Now there is an angel and series a ecosystem in at least in New York and Boston and one or two other places, um, London, and, you know, the rest of the U S is a little dodgy. Um, but not in a bad way, but just, you know, there's not enough VC. Like you've got to Austin, there's two pieces, right?

I love Austin two. Um, and one of the spun out of the other, so they all talk, right. They smoke cigars. Um, so what's happened is, uh, some of the newer incubators are actually performing a very important function, which is they are moving people around. So if you look at start made, for example, they're an Australian incubator and they have top-notch quality, um, partially because they cream skim the entire country of Australia and they pick a few of the best companies and then they'll work with them for a couple of months in Australia, but then they'll move them here to the U S and spend the last two months here and then take them around for demo day and funding.

And like founder, founder fuel is doing that out of Montreal and so on. So they're all they are building the bridge because if you're an entrepreneur in that area, you don't have that bridge the investors. Um, so you ha so you learn the incubator to help you do that. Um, so actually there, there's forming sort of symbiotic relationship with angel this because, uh, they will, uh, train the entrepreneur and help.

At the beginning and then till last piece, they'll bring them out here for the demo days and they'll put them on angel list and we'll help them meet investors as well. So when I, as, since we talked more about Angeles directly, um, how much, you know, you guys started really with the funding, um, you've done some stuff on the talent side, you've done stuff with the documents.

I mean, you seem to be sort of like ticking down the list of things that irritate entrepreneurs and in trying to make it at least more open or, or easier how much of that was the original vision of the business and how much of that is just, well, this works, let's try this. Yeah know, it's really hard to say you have a plan, you have a vision.

Uh, but it's just evolves every day. If you care about your business, if you care about your product, you're thinking about it for every minute of every hour of every day, you know, your spouse is talking to you and you're thinking about your business. And then you look back and you say, and you smile and you haven't heard a darn thing.

You said all over dinner, cause you've been visiting your business. And if you're not in that mode, then you're probably not in entrepreneur mode. Um, so given that it's very hard to draw a boundary and say, this is what we meant to do. And this is what we ended up doing. Cause the smooth continuum, you're always coming up with ideas and some are better than others.

You try them out against the marketplace. So we started with fundraising. We wanted to, we wanted to make introducing startups to investors easier. Um, and then, uh, we did some of that. And then we said, okay, we're going to go into series a that turned out to be a lot harder than we thought. We've definitely gotten dozens of series A's done, but nowhere near as many as we would like, because it's a higher bar and more of a relationship business.

Um, we thought, okay, we'll go into our small business equity capital that sort of failed. There are just not that many angels outside of the tech industry. We're going to go global. Well, there's, there's only a few towns where it sort of works. So we're big there now. And China's a black box to us, probably to everyone.

Who's not Chinese. Um, And then we thought, okay, what other verticals can we get involved in? It, it is modeled very much after Craigslist. That's not an accident that it's called angel list. Um, and the Craigslist model is help people find the connections for all the services that they need, um, and charge for very, very few of them, um, and, uh, make it seamless and quick and easy and no hassle.

And so we want to try that. And, uh, so the next thing we did was talent, which we launched a couple of months back. Um, and it's not widely advertised, but it's actually quite a bit bigger for us than fundraising. We do today about, uh, probably last week we did 300 introductions between startups and investors.

So that's mutual. Opt-in where the startup is willing to meet the investor. The investor sees the company and hits the, get an intro button. In reality, we might have done twice as many because a lot of it routes around angel list. They see the company on angel list and they go through LinkedIn because they don't want to be tracked or seen.

Um, we, but we're doing about three times that volume right now in talent, where we're connecting a curated group of developers and designers from companies that have failed, or maybe they won't leave their current company. And we're connecting them to 2000 startups, um, that are fundraising, sorry, that are, that are recruiting.

Um, and, uh, this, and we haven't advertised at all, but the set of startups that is recruiting. Actually quite the who's, who we've got Quora, Kickstarter and path and Khan academy and pocket the, read it later guys and climate Corp and just off and Yelp and all kinds of great companies that are recruiting.

Um, that to me is like the, undertold the, the whole story of what's working at angel list, uh, which the talent piece, um, we do not charge for that. Uh, we've actually been using it ourselves. That's already paid, paid itself back. We hired, uh, Misha through it and he's here somewhere. He's, he's our, uh, there he is.

Um, he's a designer with Angeles welcome Misha, and we found him through Angeles talent. And, uh, we actually made an offer yesterday to a developer that we found two Angeles time. Um, and the quality I was going through it today and it was blowing my mind. There was some really good people there and I actually almost went to the one guy we have working on it.

Now let's say, Hey, Keon, just close it down. I just want to find it first. It's like a big, it's like a big piñata don't let them get to it. I did not do that. There's no early look, but yeah, that's probably a place where we will charge over time. Um, you know, we've got to pay the bills, uh, at the end of the day, our motto is that we stand for the startups and want to do what's right for them.

And most startups don't have any money they're broke. I mean, how many people here and free or discounted tickets that's right. Don't don't raise your hand. You'll make, you'll make, you'll make your neighbor feel bad. So do women are paid the full 20 bucks, the huge 20 bucks, the pizza and the beer were thrown in.

Subtract that out. So what were the last $5 in this whole thing? Um, yeah, so, uh, right. So when it's losing money, right, startups can't afford it and uh, big companies can afford it. Big companies will pay to recruit and you're out. Sorry. Cora. Absolutely. That's right. And your average recruiter, uh, charges 25 to 30 K right now for replacing a developer designer.

I know. Cause we paid one. Right? In fact, ironically, the guy who built Angela's talent internally was the only guy we ever  twenty-five K. And then he came in and he created the system that routes around recruiters. Well, part of our, exactly. So part of our policy is we don't allow recruiters on it platform.

Uh, we want the talent to see, uh, everything that an investor would see. So they almost see the company's business plan and they see who the investors are and how much cash the company raised and who the founders are, where do they come from? And we forced the company to divulge how much equity and salary, at least a range that they're offering.

And we have thrown companies off that refuse to divulge that they got really mad at us. Uh, but we said, Hey, you know, if I'm looking for a job, I want to see this and you should be transparent. Um, and so likewise, we also promise the talent that we're going to connect you to a founder, um, or to the CEO or someone, very high ranking in the company.

You're not going to go through the normal HR screen. Um, so given that it limits our ability to put the big companies on there and the big companies are the ones that pay. Um, so it's, it's hard to charge. So we will charge, we'll probably make it in some model where the small companies can pay an equity or convertible note, or, you know, if it's real hardship, call me.

Right. Um, and it'll still be way below market also be far, far cheaper than anything else out there. But right now it's an open, open season. So go recruit. It's a big Kenyatta. How are people finding out about it? It's a good question. And I don't even fully know. I think it's word of mouth. Uh, part of it, we did send out one email to our angels user base, which gave us a little spike.

Um, I think a lot of people come in and they're thinking about creating a company and, uh, you know, they're an aspirational startup and then they see it. Uh, another one could be, um, that they are researching a particular company and they find the profile on it. Um, but right now we're adding about 250 curated and this is vetted.

So picked out of a bigger pile, um, uh, startup quality, good people every week. Um, so that's just new people entering the system. It's certainly more than any one company can keep up with. So anyone who says to me that they're having a hard time hiring right now is actually not really looking that hard.

Um, I mean, I agree it's, it's hard to hire it's non-trivial it's, but it's not hard to meet good candidates. That problem is being solved. Um, what is probably hard is to convince them to join you, right. Um, what are the other problems that you think entrepreneurs have that are not solved? You know, a big one is customers getting early customers?

Um, there's a lot of stuff that you rely on a top tier venture investor for like, uh, you know, who's a good attorney. Who's like, what do I do for my back office? Uh, you know, I need a good PR firm. Uh, I need, you know, to early enterprise customers, contacts, I need an acquire. Um, all of these people are in the Angeles ecosystem.

They all use it in various ways. I mean, we have reporters, um, you know, tech crunch, you guys, whoever who are monitoring, uh, B2B, um, uh, venture beat, um, we have, uh, M and a groups there's more than 30 M and a groups that actively use angel lists, you know, square Yahoo, Google Groupon. They pay attention to companies under the use, the research them, we just don't make it explicit.

Those are very implicit transactions and you're going to see a surfacing more. Are you going to charge for that? I mean, what is your, if your Craigslist, what is your equivalent of the, I guess, guide listing apartments, right? Craigslist charges for, uh, jobs and for real estate. Um, so I think closest, and that was the key to LinkedIn as well.

I mean, they hit profitability off of the job sites. The jobs is an obvious one. Uh, uh, another one might be, uh, that there are people who want to reach lots of startups. So today we have almost a hundred thousand, uh, startup profiles, 25,000 actively maintained and claimed. Um, and it was, Braintree's one of your sponsors, right?

There are payment processing. Um, they offer developer kit to make it painless and easy for developers to process payments. And, uh, I can say that because I'm not in the payroll, they didn't pay me anything so I can advertise your sponsor for you. Um, but I think they would like to be able to reach all the startups on angel list at the point where those startups are just getting funded.

Um, so the, the good news is we have the companies coming in, uh, before they're funded through the funding period when they get funded. And so at the right time, you can offer them more and more things. Uh, but like I said, generally, the startups don't have big, a bit of money. Um, and we, we really want to stand for the startups.

We want to make life easy for them. So we've got to find somebody else in the ecosystem to pay. Um, another thought is there are a lot of out of market. There's a lot of outer market capital sitting out there that wants to be in startups, but you go to wall street, there are hedge funds or mutual funds.

Um, right now their option is to wait until the company goes public 10 years later. Um, and there are intermediate steps at which they would like to be able to back other good people on the ground, invest in startups. So I think we can charge for access there and down the road, um, that starts getting us in a broker dealer territory.

So you also have to be regulatory compliance, more complicated. Um, but it's good for the startups because it brings more capital into the system for the startups. It gives them more options. Um, so those are other places where we can, okay. Are there things that you will never do. Yeah, we'll, we'll never charge the startups and the investors from meeting each other.

I think that's, that's just not going to happen. Uh, we don't want adverse selection and we want everyone to feel comfortable using it. We don't want anyone to have a reason not to use it. Um, so that, that is a very simple one that we will never do. Um, I also, you know, like Google has, is don't be evil. Uh, we will never do anything to screw over your startup knowingly if we do, it's an accident and I apologize, but we're not going to do it.

Um, so even the docs that are written that, that we use, they're, they're balanced, they're meant to be acceptable to the investors, but they're about as friendly of a deal as you're going to get from sophisticated investors for the entrepreneurs. So, so they're very much, um, written with the entrepreneurs and mind.

Have you had debates in house of ways that you could be monetizing the service and like some people think, well, this is still this isn't doing something bad. And then other people think there are, I mean, she's got to be some of those gray areas.

Yeah. You know, it's funny. The investors always come up with the same one. They always come to me. They say, why don't you charge every investor who was on angel list? Like, no, I don't want to do that. I want to give them a reason to not be on angel list, but they say, nah, no one would care. You could charge them, you know, a thousand bucks a year.

Like, well, that's worth it. I might as well sell tickets depending on

Uh, so we're not gonna do that. Uh, but for some reason, the investors always come up with that business model, but there's been no debate around that. What about like the thing that I always hear that entrepreneurs hate is like, when they have a liquidity event and then it's like all the wealth managers just come out of the woodwork and like, we'll go through.

I mean, I always call them zombies because it's like, they will plow through a bar and trying to get to you. I mean, they'll just like this happened with me with tech crunch and I didn't make any money off of the tech crunch. That's always the best part when they show up thinking you're written the worst of this without the money I'm still on two or three email lists about private jet.

I have no idea how that happened. Um, I mean, what if like wealth managers were like, I want to pay you to access people who like, like that would piss people off. Yeah. I wouldn't do that. It's like, yeah. Putting a Doberman and someone it's not nice. No, I don't think we're going to go down that route. I think if we make some money, it'll be on, it'll be basically providing a service that you clearly agree was incredibly useful.

Probably not related to fundraising. Um, and, uh, where we'll still charge a below market rate. I mean, it's just so much more efficient to do everything in the cloud, frankly, you know, to some extent, if you look at what a top tier venture fund does for you, one of the things they do is they connect you to their network, right?

Like Fred Wilson was quoted as saying that he believes his Rolodex is his most powerful asset in the venture business. And, uh, and recent said in a fortunate interview, he said that, um, every time we expanded our network, our entrepreneurs said we want more network, more network, more network. Well, the network has an information good.

It doesn't cost much to give it away. Um, so I think we're going to basically make the network part very, very widely available for everyone. It's very low cost for us. Um, and we can charge kind of a cost plus and still have it be way, way, way cheaper than the other rate that you might pay. Um, so love, want to get back to deal flow because I think this was something that.

You know, I've covered venture for a long time, and it's the big proprietary thing that, you know, whoever's the top dog in Silicon valley has. I mean, this is what VCs really worry about what the super angels, and this is why they've had, you know, these sort of stealthy scalp programs and, you know, tried to invest in the super angels and partner with them and have these accelerator programs.

They're all worried about not getting in that center of that deal flow. How did, how, how do you think you have disrupted deal flow? Proprietary deal flow is dead. And to the extent that proprietary deal flow still exists, it's because the entrepreneur is not being smart about it. The entrepreneur is basically self-limiting the market for their shares.

Uh, and that's just silly. Uh, the good news is there are dozens of great venture firms, not five or 10 there's dozens, maybe hundreds, maybe over a hundred. Um, there are hundreds, maybe thousands of great angels who have started their own companies, exited them are operators and are very entrepreneur friendly.

And you're just not going to reach them knocking on doors one by one. Right? So to that extent, uh, the incubator demo days, the conferences, uh, you know, when you get up at a launch conference or a tech crunch, Um, and, uh, then various networking events and of course, angel is commoditize that they opened that up and they, they allow you to create more of a market for your shares.

Um, so generally what I find is the, the people who are really proprietary with their companies and only want to show it to a select few investors. Um, and I hate to insult my own generation, but it's the older entrepreneurs. They're still doing things the old fashioned way, whereas the younger ones, but we in checking and tweeting in, you know, they know that it's an open transparent world.

Um, so they're, they're more open-minded about who they talk to. Uh, and so I think proprietary deal flow is basically dead. Uh, the, the percentage of deal flow that was proprietary and closed, uh, in 2007, it was probably, you know, 90%, uh, today it's probably less than 50 and declining fast. Um, and it's, and it's now going across into other, uh, other verticals too, like enterprise and biotech and part of what's driving it is that people need less money so they can, they can raise it for many more kinds of investors.

Part of it is all the platforms like us and Y Combinator. Um, part of it is that, uh, because you need less money, you can actually launch your product and then go raise money. And so you don't have as much to hide. The secrecy element has gone away to a large degree. Uh, so I think proprietary deal flow is dead.

Now. Now what VCs do have is proprietary. Which is their ability to get into a deal. Um, and some, and they're really hot deals, especially the consumer ones are sort of obvious to everyone because they're, they're getting crazy numbers. So everybody wants to get in. So how do you get in and that's about your brand and your access and your know-how your knowledge.

Um, but even there, I don't think it's all necessarily good news for the investors. Um, it's good news for the top top tier because their brands are so powerful, like an Andreessen or a Sequoia can out muscle, almost anyone getting into a deal. Uh, but that being said, uh, there are a lot of emergent brands.

The super angels are all emergent brands, Google ventures, you know, it comes out of nowhere and Yuri Milner. Um, so there are a lot of new brands and most of the new brands that have come out in the last few years, uh, have been built on the notion of being entrepreneurial friendly. Y Combinator is built on that notion we're built on that notion, uh, true ventures and recent they're all built on the notion of we're going to do what's right for the entrepreneur, even if it's economically bad for us.

Um, I wasn't a deal as an investor with a SV angel and this was a while back. And, uh, I remember the company was shutting down and had like 75,000 bucks left in the bank and it was not a large amount of money. And a SV angel basically just said, okay, we're just gonna let the entrepreneur keep the remainder and use it to, you know, find his next job and take them over.

I was like, wow, that was mind blowing. And so we all went along. We followed that lead, but it was a very nice thing for them to do. And I think they've also built their brand on being very entrepreneurial friendly. So, uh, I don't know where I was going with this. I'm rambling. At this point, you should probably take access it's about access.

It is not about deal flow anymore. And so a lot of the firms that are doing consumer investing are falling all over themselves, trying to figure out how do I differentiate myself? How do I get access into good companies? Um, and that, that is the current name of the game is not about deal flow anymore.

Anyone who does not have great deal flow should get on angel list. Cause we have great deal flow and Angeles it's all there. Right? So what about the role that you sort of the brand that each venture capitalist is building for themselves as playing? I mean, you know, when I first moved here venture, capital's sort of coming out of the shadows for the first time.

And then after the crash, there was a real reaction to it. And everyone, you know, you're best friends with benchmark, I think were the most extreme cause they had a book written about them and they were like, we are not ever going to talk to a reporter for five years. And you know, Sequoia was very famous for this.

They would for many years just say, it's, you know, it's not about us. It's about the companies and whether or not they really believe that in the way they acted with a company can be debated, but they certainly did not go out there in the press and brand themselves. And you know, didn't, didn't want to be out there.

You know, I talked to VCs all the time now who feel like in these sort of hybrid Dave McClure, Marc Andreessen era, if you don't have a big brand for yourself, you know, you're, you're kind of hosed. But at what point does that become, you're taking credit for what the entrepreneur's done and kind of come back to bite you?

Yeah. Brand is a really weird thing. I personally, I just think it's funny how, uh, they've managed to brand mine and it's the ultimate commodity, right? It's like branding oil, like, do you really care about shell versus Chevron? Um, but it turns out you do. And the reason you do is because the VC brand often reflects how nice they're going to be to you once they have control.

So it goes back to this entrepreneur friendly thing, because if you raise a large amount of money, eventually you will lose board control. You will have VCs kind of controlling the, uh, you know, your relationship in the company and your tenure and supporting you or not supporting you. If you ever hit a hiccup, you're going to have to get a bridge round from them because no one from the outside wants to hit fund you while you're on the decline and those terms matter.

So to me, brand is much less about value add, and it's much more about entrepreneur friendliness. So I encourage entrepreneurs go for whoever trusts you likes you and will support you over who you think is going to add value because the add value thing you can now get from many places, you could argue that the incubators have taken over a lot of the early network and value add and advice giving, uh, you know, good advisors are cheap.

If let's say that there's a investor who says they're gonna be value added, but you're going to pay 2 million bucks in your evaluation. Well, I guarantee you can find great equivalent advisors for a lot less than $2 million. You can give them stock. Um, so it really boils down to how are they going to treat you when there's control issue?

So the good news is it's pushing the industry and entrepreneur friendly direction, and that that's where the best brands are built. There's really been an aggressive move against the value. Add VCs, bring, I mean, you know, we had mark Pincus, uh, you know, a couple months ago and he said that, you know, Yuri Milner is ideal investor because he doesn't want a board seat.

He gives you lots of money. He doesn't bother you. I mean, you know, over and over again, when you talk to entrepreneurs, you hear that. And I feel like that's been the fashionable thing that people have gone after Daniel Lac actually sort of said the same thing in his fundraising advice last week, but for an entrepreneur kind of coming to Silicon valley for the first time, it's not really good to optimize for an investor who, you know, either as a seed investor, like, you know, Dave McClure or Ron Conway's so spread so thin or, um, you know, someone whose brand is about, I'm not going to take a board seat or bother you.

Isn't there some role for VCs and investors being nobody else is going to care to the level that a VC who has a lot in the company will care, but that can backfire on you too. So I think it ends up being a mix and the market is finding its bearings on this, but you get your early advice from the incubator and your early network from there.

Uh, and then after that you get your first big bet from a mokoro or Conway, because they are very prolific with writing those early stage checks. At least you get an early believer. And then you'll probably have one or two angels in your round who have invested more, really care more about the company, and maybe you put them on your board or you make them Sherpas or advisors.

And then by the time the VC comes along, you have this other constituency that can advise you, support you to making sure you have a balanced relationship with a VC and an unbalanced one. Um, like how many VCs are gonna screw over a YC company. Right. Um, so they have a little cartel over there. The basically the entrepreneurs have almost through the incubators.

Um, so, uh, I think it's a good balance. It's a healthy balance, but definitely it used to be that there was just, you had to get everything in one, you got your advice, you control your money and your brand from one investor. And so you had this bundle and there were only 20 of them and you only had two term sheets.

They done a lot of choices. Now you can mix and match a lot more. It's a good thing. Choice is good. Um, do to be savvier as an entrepreneur to negotiate that. Uh, you have to be very savvy. It's, it's actually a little unfortunate, but, uh, the lead in, in a company, whoever that founder is, who's spending all their time doing the investors.

I feel like half of a founders, one founder of the team will spend roughly half their time over the life of the company, just dealing with investors or investor issues. And the investors don't want to acknowledge this, but I've been on the entrepreneur side enough to know that either you're pitching an investor or you're keeping them happy, or you're looking for the next one, uh, or you're negotiating with them, or you're working on their pet project or whatever it is.

Right. But there's just a lot that goes on. Uh, so it, it can be a real time suck. Um, there's I still hear, um, investors say that not every company should be listing on angel list that there's, there's some sense of you should raise your money first and then list on there to get a lot of the job benefits or recruiting benefits, right?

Yeah. I don't, I don't think it's an investor's interest to send you to the market. Right. That's just obvious. Um, so you have to kind of consider where the advice is coming from. Uh, it's true because angel is an online medium. It has different characteristics than fundraising, offline fundraising. Offline is a lot more about the personal relationship.

So you can actually convince someone just through your charm. Uh, whereas angel, this is because Maya's much more objective. So they're going to go based on your metrics, the quality of your product, and frankly, who else is in your round gives you some social. Some credibility. Um, or what famous advisor do you have or what incredible award have you won or what have you done?

So if you can't show it, if you have to tell it, then yes, Angeles will not work as well for you, but if you can show it, angels will actually work better for you. Cause you get to show it to thousands of investors at once instead of just the five that you happen to meet, right? So you can end up with a very competitive round, uh, where you can really set the terms the way you want.

But if what's helping you get that competitive round is having a superstar advisor or having a good angel. I mean, like in the case of rally, they had Mike Maples and they had, you know, Reid Hoffman, I mean, are you really opening up the market that much? Cause those guys could get the money. Absolutely.

There are lots and lots of companies that come in Angeles and get funded that have no investors to start out local, who did their seed and their a and they had no investors coming in Talia did their entire a um, so you know, you can, you can absolutely do that. You just have to have something else compelling and credible to show.

Um, so I would say today is probably about half and half, half the companies that we feature, um, have good committed investors and have. There they're actually just starting out. And what we're starting to do now is, uh, for a lot of companies that come in that are too early to even have something to show, but they just have a good team.

Uh, we're passing them to incubators. Um, so we did that with 500 startups last month, uh, where in a two week period, we sent them 600 companies. Uh, all the data was structured, rank, weighted, sorted, social graph, everything. You can see where the Stanford founders are and who was connected to a mentor. We gave them a process queue, just like we used to go through them.

Uh, and they took in a whole bunch of companies and they liked it enough. They're going to use Angeles as their standard acceptance, uh, mechanism into their accelerator from now on. Um, and actually, I mean, there's not a real announcement announcement, like isn't that a press announcement, but we're going to do the same thing starting tomorrow, uh, for both angel pad and Techstars Boston, I believe.

Um, and I think by Q1 next year, you're going to see dozens and dozens of incubators that will basically take your application directly from angel list. So you build your references and your profile in one place. Um, and then if you want to go for angel money, you can do that. But if you're early, um, and you want to go for an incubator, you can go click, click, click, and off you go.

Interesting. Um, there's also by the way, a bunch of VC funds, um, who use angel list who find their initial a hundred K season. So I can't announce them yet, but there are two that we're already working with internally where they've kind of review, basically every deal that goes through that is above a minimum quality threshold, basically not spam.

Um, and they say, Hey, do I want to be the first one in to write a hundred K check into that company? So the companies are getting looked at by people who are using it to find seed deals. So how does, how did those partnerships work for you? Cause I know when we talked about the, the seed documents, you know, it was in your best interest to have, there was, there was a law for me launched with, I believe it was Wilson Sonsini and it was your, but it was in your best interest to get sort of as many as possible.

So it didn't look like there was preferential treatment. You know, I imagine with incubators and investors, you know, that's going to be, that gives people another reason to hate you, who are looking for reasons to change. I mean, it's going to be open. Like everyone can use it better, can use it. Every investor can use it.

Uh, all these prosecutors are going to be open. Um, so there's no, there's no preferential. And does that kill some of the advantage? I mean, if, you know, again like your dentist has to be done in their brand and what they have to offer, you made her an investor opting into this. You were based there basically accepting there's your premise that there's no longer a world with proprietary deal flow.

That's right. It's 500 startups is not getting a better class of applications than Techstars Boston or whatever, 500 startups. Uh, you want as much deal flow as you can get. Uh, 500 startups actually has a huge worldwide network. There are people on the ground in Mexico and Brazil and New York, you know, all kinds of.

Uh, London and, uh, India. Um, so they are going to get some proprietary deal flow, but they also realize that there are a ton of great companies on AngelList who are coming in not necessarily four or 500 startups are coming in to raise angel money. And 500 startups would love to also have a look at them and try and convince them by five minutes.

So there are many investors who believe there is a stigma to listing on angel list and that they, they say that they see deals that did the circuit, that couldn't raise money and magically, they raise money on angel list and they argue there's some adverse selection. Do you think that is still a legitimate issue?

You guys deal with it. And so I think we've been around long enough now that you can see the success cases. I mean, Uber was on page of list. Pinterest was on Angeles. Branch-Out was on Angeles rally Kaggle Recurly flashed off, it got sold. I mean, there's, you can go to a done deals page. There are 2000 companies that have been on angel list that have gone on to raise big rounds.

And the alumni have now raised over 1.3 billion, and that's a trailing number of we don't get the last six months cause they don't announce their financings. Um, so the real number is probably closer to 2 billion. Um, there are acquisitions that have been done because of Angeles, right? So, um, you can sit there and pretend that, you know, it's not happening, but it's happening.

You can bury your head in the sand if you want. There are VCs who tell me, especially ones who are out of market. Like they're not in Silicon valley who basically say we would not be in business if it were not for you. Um, we've had, uh, recently a good. Um, we had a bar, we added a Brussels based VC who has already done three deals on angel list, including a series, a two for companies in Austin, one for a company here.

Normally those companies would never have been able to reach that. You'll see that VC would never be able to reset investor. Uh, there's a company we'll announce shortly. Uh, they did their seed on angel list. Then they're a, they had a term sheet here from a well-known VC and we've got an, a term sheet from a VC in London.

They flew back and forth. They talked to the London guys, decided they liked them better, a better evaluation, better partners went with that. So those channels that just opened up, you can't do offline. Right? I want to, I do want to go to questions in a minute so that Dave or whoever else is out there, that I, before I yell at them, they can ask you whatever.

Um, but I, I want to talk about that. Your experience with the jobs act first, Ben Horowitz, when he was here was talking about how impressed he was, that you went to Washington and changed the law. Is that how you would characterize what happened? Uh, we definitely were very involved in it. Uh, the securities laws are written in 1934, which is a long time ago.

Um, probably, I mean, they probably reference a Telegraph in there somewhere. Um, and so w a lot of the ma you know, a lot of the stuff that goes on in incubator demo days and at these conferences is technically illegal. You know, w when someone stands up at demo day as a mentor and says, you should invest in this company, that's.

Cook completely kosher or says, here's a standardized term sheet that we're using. This is the standard angel pair or Techstars note that is not legal, that you're supposed to be a broker dealer if you're doing those kinds of things. Um, so, uh, all of this was operating very much in the gray area of the securities laws.

And, uh, you know, we bend over backwards to be securities laws compliant. We were full legal opinion up and all that stuff, and we'd never touched money. It's part of the reason. Um, but it's still pretty scary. And there were a bunch of, uh, products who want to offer like darks that we could not legally do.

It was just illegal for us to offer a docs product without being a broker dealer. Broker dealer means you have all these regulations and requirements. We actually make it impossible to work with startups. Um, so we wanted to get the law changed. People told us it was impossible, um, which it actually is basically impossible.

Um, we hired a bunch of gumshoe lobbyists who are awesome and we paid them purely on like a contingency victory fee. And then we just pull that all the stuffs. It turns out a friend of friends through friends at Twitter, actually. And then, uh, w what really made the difference was we were doing something that we thought was pretty good, which was we were spreading, uh, investment and investing around the country.

And that's really what Congress wants to hear right now, which is okay, you are helping companies in my jurisdiction get funded. Um, and so when we went to Congress and we said, this needs to exist, um, you know, all the lobbyist can do is open a door for you. You still got to make the pitch. Um, and we basically showed them how in every.

In almost every major city, we had a bunch of investors and we had a bunch of startups who are willing to stand up for, for what we were doing. Um, so there's just all this good karma that was paid back. And I spent six months of my life just calling in favors left and right. And it turns out there were a lot of them to call it.

Um, you know, it's like that old, there's this old show in TV, stingray where this guy drives around and like solve people's problems and get fights crime. But what he does is at the end, when they say, what do I owe you? He always says, you owe me a favor. Let's say I'll call it in Sunday. And then he gets all this done by spending favors.

So he thought I was, turns out he has contacts here and there, we can call in favors the math doesn't work. Cause he calls him five favors every time. So he gets one back.

Yeah, but we haven't, we had a different ratio. So we called in a lot of favors. We had a lot of friends, we got lots of favors. What are examples, quickly call up your Congressman. Uh, tell them that you are an impressive entrepreneur or investor. Tell them you raise money or you invest it because of angel list.

Tell them that this is a good thing. Tell them that you want us to be able to offer docs, tell them that you want us to be able to do these new features, um, and tell them that they want to support this kind of activity. Um, you know, the, the general solicitation law is still in effect, but it's about to go away shortly means that if I were to stand up right here and say, by the way, we're fundraising, I have broken the law and I've invalidated my financing for the next.

Every time you write an article that says that this company is raising money, boom, you've destroyed their financing. And normally you guys don't care about it because we operate in such a closed little environment here, but angels is online and it's global. So it's very visible. You become a target. Um, you get sued, you get attacked by regulators, by a state by state.

Um, so these were the kinds of things that we had to basically make sure, uh, were taken care of and the jobs act did it. It was the only bipartisan act signed by this con pass by this Congress in the last four years. Um, we got to go to the rose garden and Obama signed it and I have a copy and sitting next to me, uh, signed by him, uh, which is great.

It's a, and there's a story there I'd wrote a book someday. Um, it was really fun and really cool. Well, thanks a lot for coming here and saying there's a great story and not telling it to, I mean, it's just all crazy, but he's willing to pay $40 to get the good store. You know, it's funny, it's one of those things it's like where you pull a hundred favors, right?

Um, like I had Mitch Kapoor call up and I issue was a Silicon valley rep and that Steve case, you know, work with us to get a piece in his recommendation to the council and so on. And you call in literally a hundred favors and each one of them takes a toll on you at the end of the day, a random five magically come together and make it happen.

Uh, and then at the end, for a while, it looked like I was going to get shot down in the Senate. I mean, by the way, we had to put together this crazy thing we had to like satisfy the investment banks and the regulators and all these different constituencies. And it ended up being. A giant dog's breakfast of different bills that combined together.

And then some genius, you know, I don't know who, but I can almost imagine it's sitting around some, probably some congressional staffer is like, how are we gonna get this thing to pass? Right. It doesn't make any sense. Oh, let's call it. The state has some to do the jobs. What does it have to do a job? I'm starting my business, startups, startups, and then what congressperson can vote against something called the jobs.

So it was a, it was a miracle, right? It was literally America. Um, and, uh, you know, we had, you don't even know who, I don't know who did that, but there was a lot of stuff going on. There was a guy who works with our COO Kevin laws. Coincidentally who's like the most likable pleasant person, you know, grew up in Pennsylvania.

He went with me to. You know, I get angry. So I'm like Travis, you know, from Uber, where if somebody says, well, you know, all this should be regulated. We're from Silicon valley, right. Believe in regulation. Um, but, uh, Kevin was, you know, would talk them through and he'd be friends with everyone and he'd get everyone to like him.

And he got everyone to agree and he'd nod along. And, uh, you know, we get phone calls from staffers and they tell us the politics to be like, well, he's going to vote against this because he voted against him on this bill. And they're actually horsetrading on this. And , and if you can get Goldman Sachs to sign off on this, then we can trigger this hole.

And this piece will go through, how do you do this? Right. So it was like every day, there's like a new puzzle to solve. Um, so there were just, there were tons of these little things and then you will put them all together just somehow I still can't believe it just sort of magically came together. Um, but it was one of those things that I went into thinking there was a 10% chance this will work and it will cost us X dollars worth of effort.

And so multiply it through expected value is still worth it, but we'll probably fail, but we didn't. So we got lucky. So was there anything that was a takeaway from that experience that, that other, you know, groups in the valley who want to see stuff passed to take, I mean, you know, you were going in with something called the jobs act.

Other people are going and trying to like get, you know, reform around immigration, which is a very hard thing. So the moment you say immigration, you're mixing skilled and unskilled and you're in trouble, so they need to rebrand branding is important. Right? And the other thing is we insisted the entire time that we were going to approach the process.

Like a startup and we were told you cannot approach it like a startup. So for example, anyone that we had to pay, we paid them success fees, right. Or like, you don't get paid if we don't succeed. Um, but they said, that's just not the way it's done. Right. But that's the way we did it. And another thing was, um, we were asked the last second, it looked like it wasn't going to pass the Senate.

And they said, you really have to show your support. You have to show that there are people out there who support this. And so I said, get a, get a petition to get a letter signed by a bunch of. So we said, okay, we're going to do it our way. We're going to do a little Twitter petition, and we're going to have login with Angeles or author Twitter, and we're going to have everyone's photos and their bios and all that stuff.

And they said, no, that stuff matters. They just want a word document, right? Just like, get a bunch of signatures, stop acting Silicon valley, but we ignored them. And so in like one frenzied, 36 hour period, we pulled an all-nighter and we basically put out this viral Twitter petition that got signed by 5,000 investors and entrepreneurs and not 5,000 randoms, but these are investors and entrepreneurs.

And we were able to slice and dice it by location and how influential, where they were and what they invested in and what they look like and who their Senator was and all that stuff. And then we sent this to Congress and the, and one of the unions who was afraid that the jobs that could be used to take advantage of like older people or union workers somehow opposed it.

So they ran their own petition. You know, these unions are men with some millions of members, so they got 3,600 signatures again. So we got 5,004, but ours was beautiful and visual and show these people powerful. And we were like, yeah, I see that guy. He's one of the big campaign donors. We can do those kinds of links and we just crushed it.

And I think Congress thought, oh my God, this is so far Piper all over again. And a lot of people who are in opposition dropped it and he got passed. So we managed to, uh, use technology as a weapon in this cause. And I don't think we should be afraid of acting. Um, and so that was part of the lesson. That's awesome.

why don't we go to some questions from that answers a microphone there and a microphone there, um, guys line up and while people are amassing, um, there's been a lot of criticism about how long it's going to take the jobs act to actually get enacted. I mean, where are we? I mean, it's a whole sort of mess of things going on.

Yeah. There's a big bunch of it. That's already in effect. Uh, the 500 shareholder rule is already in effect. Uh, the general solicitation rule will probably get lifted in January. Um, there are pieces around broker dealer laws that are already in effect. Um, the crowdfunding piece is the one that's taking the longest, but rightly so, it's ridiculously complicated, which is how do you prevent small investors who haven't met the company don't have a track record of investing, uh, how do you prevent them from getting ripped off?

Um, and the sec has to design a system where it's restrictive enough that it's not easily frauded and, uh, it's not so restricted, the good companies that stay off and I don't envy them that problem. I think it's really hard to solve. And I think it will probably take them the better part of next year of figuring it out.

What do you think about companies like, um, funders club who are, you know, and there's a ton of these guys who are trying to do stuff around crowdfunding already who were kind of getting out in front of that. Yeah. So we're, we actually have an experiment going with crowd funding right now. You can invest online, small dollar amounts on it.

Uh, but it's through second market and that's our, we have a little partnership with them and they're a registered broker dealer. Um, so we think it's worth trying to do in our early experiments have actually been quite successful, but you really have to be careful about being compliant with the securities laws.

Uh, if you jump the gun, the problem is you're taking money from small investors who are likely going to lose their money because most startups this morning, and this is their first time losing money. So they're going to get bent out of shape and they're going to Sue somebody and they're going to Sue you.

And so if you don't have an ironclad defense, and if you weren't fully a hundred percent securities law compliant, uh, the penalties actually can go to you personally, uh, long after your startup is gone. So if you're, if you're using these kinds of systems, you really have to make sure you're a hundred percent securities law compliance.

So that means that you do have to get your lawyer involved. Um, that means you do have to do legal diligence. And I would say right now, our read on it is that the best way to do that is through a broker dealer. So you're, you are not of the belief that this is a Napster, Uber like situation where you change the laws by breaking them.

Uh, I mean, yeah, Napster is a good example of why you may not want to think that Uber is a very different case because. Uber is, you know, and disclaimer, I'm a small investor in Uber, um, from when they use Angeles. But I like, I like Lyft also and, and sidecar and all the others in the space and Airbnb, you know, these guys are breaking or not breaking.

They're routing around local laws and local issues. And those laws are more easily fungible. And in some ways they're actually more antiquated because local governance is smaller. It's more easily hijacked by corporate interests. Um, so you know, the number of medallions and taxi media in San Francisco is a crying shame, essentially when it is more taxis.

And so people know that they know it's hard to get a cab. So, uh, while the people aren't looking, you can have some shady business, uh, you're gonna have shape as the city council, but once people are paying attention and galvanized on it, the law is going to change because people want their cabs. They want their Uber's, they want their lifts.

Um, so given that I think they actually have a different issue than the Napsters of the world, right. Who were basically just, uh, that music, you know, was available in other ways. But now it's just like free, right? So that's a very different thing. Um, so I think long-term the Uber's and Lyft's, and the Airbnb Airbnb's of the world will win all their fights.

Uh, it's just going to be a cost of doing business for them. It will be, but you shouldn't have the same philosophy when it comes to crowdfunding. How does it, the securities laws are radioactive. They're very different. Uh, the securities laws are not. You know, if you get it, for example, if you raise money from an unaccredited investor, um, or if you raise money and handle money through an unlicensed broker dealer, your entire transaction is void.

Not just the bit you did through them, but all the money you raised from all the other investors too. And they have a right of rescission, which means they can put the stock back on you personally, once they decide it's lost money. Um, so those securities laws are not changing any time soon. Even the crowdfunding, when it comes through, you can't get ahead and get out ahead in front of it because nobody knows what's gonna look like you don't know what the final rules are going to be.

So by definition, you're already breaking some of them. Um, so I don't think you can expect to get grandfathered in. And then even if you do, you can always get sued by your own investors when they lose money. So that that's civil, right. They have to see you doesn't go away. So don't mess with the securities laws.

Like, yes, we went, we got the law change first, then we're doing stuff. I wouldn't do it in the order. All right, great. Go ahead. You might've already answered my question. I read a article in tech blog a few months ago about something else, and they were talking about angel list and people investing in using five to $10,000 and actually investing in.

It sounds like that's what you were talking about. As soon as I got up here. Yeah. That that's, uh, you know what we're doing with second market. So there are a couple of companies on Angeles today and where you can go, you can review the profile and if you like what you see, you can invest a small amount online and then we'll send you off to second market.

They'll actually test you for suitability accreditation, Patriot act requirements, and then happily take your money and pass it on. Um, so we're trying to right now, but, uh, to be securities law compliant, it only works for accredited investors. It only works for investors who understand the risks, uh, as judged by the broker dealer.

Um, and, uh, it's, uh, it has to be done through second market or an equivalent broker deal. But is this where your business is going eventually once this is all legal, once it's out in the open, we'll see. I honestly don't know. I don't know. It's like any startup, you know, you try a lot of things, $20 tickets.

We'll see how it goes here. So I love this last part on where you're butting heads with regulations and I'm going to, I'd like to follow up on that for a second. Cause it seems like most of the, the innovation and most of the things that you've been able to enable have been in spaces where there has not been another large hurdle that people had to go up against like the FDA.

Right. Do you think AngelList can be as much of a force for good, um, in the biotech space or in a context where people have to go up against other imminent regulations? Yeah, it's really frustrating. What's going on. And they, for example, with the FDA where a lot of biotech innovation and testing is, is moving overseas, uh, cause the approval cycles here are insane.

Uh, I don't know if we can solve that, but one thing we can do is at least by assembling the community of startups, hopefully giving them. Uh, there's no question that, uh, Congress is paying a lot more attention to Silicon valley now. Uh, it's mainly because of SOPA and Piper, secondarily, because of the jobs act, it's coming up again with a startup visa.

Uh, there's a lot of money here. There's a lot of influence here. Everyone's using the iPhone, everyone's using Android. Um, so Congress gets that and I think, you know, so Barack Obama do the, uh, Ima on Reddit. Um, so I think we're going to have a lot more influence in the future. It's not going to come soon enough.

Um, things like the FDA will take forever because those are highly re you know, uh, highly controlled regulatory bodies with deep entrenched interests, maybe in a decade timeframe. Uh, but there are also regulatory bodies that have been, uh, very favorable to innovation. Uh, I would argue that a lot of the innovation that is even possible today in Silicon valley wouldn't have happened.

If the FCC hadn't taken a forward looking stance, uh, you do see the FCC actually passing rules to unbundle more spectrum, to, uh, release it from broadcasters to. Uh, you know, like the, the Verizon iPhone five, uh, if you buy it, it's unlocked and it's unlocked because the FCC said, if you want LTE spectrum, then any phone you sell Verizon on that LTE spectrum has to be unlocked.

Um, so I hope that's a good model that, uh, more regulatory bodies can follow, but I'm not holding my breath. Um, it would be good for us to be more, more helpful in that regard. And we'll try it. I think when the startup visa act comes up, I I've been very explicit with Steve case and others that, uh, when that comes up for a vote and if it is narrowly enough targeted at the Silicon valley interest, I E we don't have to, you know, make a decision on 10 other things that are bundled with it.

Um, we will do our best to get our community organized behind it. What do you think the odds of that getting passed are? I think they're actually, if it's, if it's targeted enough, I actually think it's quite high, uh, especially because of the, the drubbing that the Republicans took from the Hispanic book in this most recent election.

Um, there's now suddenly a lot of bipartisan vote on immigration. Excuse me. That said the worst thing that could happen to the, uh, start-up visa is it gets bundled into the larger immigration debate. Uh, what's more likely though, is that it could be viewed as a quick win something that they can pass to, that they can all agree on that, you know, gets the, uh, gets the wheels grease for the bigger immigration act.

Okay, great. Hi, my question is about lawyers. Like what do you see the future of lawyers is angel list going to take them totally out of the equation? You can just sign a standard document with investors and just get your money, uh, most lawyers. So by the way, Wilson Sonsini and Cooley and mofo, and a bunch of others will actually do the closing online for free using angel the stocks.

Uh, there's not about a half dozen of them, although we haven't fully announced it. Ben probably knows the full list. Um, but they never viewed the, uh, docs as a, uh, as a profit center. It was a loss leader for them to acquire the customer and the cost didn't come and actually do the docs. It came in all the back and forth negotiation because everybody wants their pet, uh, their pet sentence or pet clause or pet phrase in there.

And so by moving it all online and standardizing it, where we basically said, it's free, you want to change anything? It's suddenly $20,000. So now it puts the onus on the first person who was about to submit their pet clause to say no, because it'll reveal to all the other investors that, oh yeah, that guy is his little special closet costing you 20 grand.

Um, and so it just, it uses social pressures to standardize rather than actually, uh, you know, it's not, uh, the time-saving comes in, not in not having a negotiation, not in creating the paperwork. Um, so I think the, the lawyers will continue to work with the company afterwards. You still need a lawyer for all kinds of things.

And that's just, you know, some of it is, is good hygiene. And some of it is just the regular environment we live in. Uh, I actually have a side point of view that I don't think any startup can be in business if they follow every. Like, if you just went, you actually read all the regulations, you're pinning up on the wall, according to San Francisco laws.

Like, you'd be like, oh yeah, breaking that one, breaking that one shut down right here. So you can't, you can't pay to too much attention to them. And luckily a lot of the smaller, a lot of them are not enforced against smaller companies. Um, but you, you, you still definitely do need a lawyer. So necessarily part of doing business.

And by the way, the best lawyers are actually advisors. You can think of them as cheap advisors. There are a few lawyers in the valley who have actually built a reputation of being founder friendly. And I really encourage you to seek those lawyers out because they can be a good counterweight sometimes against them.

I mean, there's entrepreneurs in that room, like name names, this is helpful to them. Well, um, you know, I think buddy R and I'm at Perkins Cooey is kind of got that reputation. Um, I'm blanking Pillsbury, uh, there's uh, uh, Jorge Del Cabo has that reputation. Uh, I use Eric Benetech, you know, as a boutique lawyer, VBL, he's really good Silicon legal Andre cookery spun out and formed his own little firm that they're now actually startup lawyers.

Um, so those are good ones to seek out, but there, there are quite a few of them. Um, we will add a category at some point to angel list that will show you, um, good lawyers and what companies are associates. Um, you know, Ted Wang is now a lawyer to the stars cause he's a lawyer to Facebook, but he has a out to the stars thing.

But yeah, he, he did the whole, uh, ecosystem of a great service by releasing series seed. Uh, you know, uh Yocum uh, at, uh, Carlos, is he okay? Paul needs a lawyer. Yeah. Yokum loves Paul business there. It's the next best thing to be? Michael Harrington's lawyer, Mike players too. He does. There's a lot of good ones out there.

Okay, awesome. I would say if anything, the lawyers have had to do more work branding themselves and provide more value to the ecosystem than the investors, because the investors can always write you a check. There's my value. Add lawyer. You've got to pay them. So they really have to convince you that they know their stuff.

Hmm. All right. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah. So a number of RJ here, uh, my question is what is a successful angel list profile? Uh, I'm struggling with, at what point do I list myself the startup on angel list in idea phase or when I have all my advisors and everything lined up. I mean, you have a lot of stuff there that you have to kind of check, check, check, check, check.

I'm just wondering if we can talk to that. You can listen if anytime, but with a hundred thousand companies on there, you're not going to get noticed until you get promoted or something unique or special comes along. So you can build your profile with impunity. Um, if there's anything even mildly interesting about it, we'll follow it and keep track.

Um, you're probably not going to get funded until you either have traction or you have a pretty unique product, or unless you just have a stellar team assembled, uh, or you have some social proof. Those are the four things that investors look at. Uh, like I said, starting tomorrow, you'll be able to use it to apply to angel pad and to Techstars, um, and of course, 500 startups in the next cycle.

And we're going to announce, uh, uh, probably dozens more. Um, so you also be able to use it earlier stage for that basis. So I don't think there's any downside to creating it early. Just keep working on it. Um, just the, the thing that's, uh, the, the, the part where you might do yourself, a disservice is if you just leave things, uh, blank that are obvious, like the team stuff, you know, take the time to fill out the team bios, um, because investors really do at the end of the day, they fund teams, everything else is a kind of proxying or, uh, you know, if you have traction definitely enlisted.

Um, I like to think there's no such thing as too early. I know a lot of different memes get spread. The reality is you're not going to get noticed until something spectacular shows up in your profile or unless we promote it, there's just too much. What do you mean when you say traction and social proof?

I feel like those are terms that get thrown around and a lot of startups, like don't really know what that is. If they have it, or what they're aiming for proof is when somebody who's worth listening to believes in you. And they show that in some way, if it's an advisor, they commit their time. If it's an investor that commit them.

Um, or it could just be that you recruited some incredible team member, excuse me, like you recruited a core contributor, a Ruby on rails to be on your developer team. That is a form of social proof. Cause that person's committing their time. Um, traction is, uh, basically quantitative evidence of customer demand.

So if you're an enterprise software, it might be two or three or the customers are paying a bit, uh, if it's in a consumer, you know, it might be in the bar might be as high as hundreds of thousands of users. Uh, if it's an, uh, mobile apps, you know, might be your download rate. Um, but, uh, sorry if I've used this joke before, cause now I use it all the time, but it's like, it's the Supreme court definition of porn, you know, you'll know it when you see it.

Um, so you, you, you you'll know attraction is, and investors know attraction is, it is a moving target. Um, the, the entire ecosystem is any far more efficient companies are accomplishing a lot less, a lot more with a lot less two years ago, you could've gotten your daily deal, startup funded pre traction. Uh, 18 months ago, you could not have gotten a daily deal, startup funded, no matter how much traction you had 12 months ago.

Um, you know, you could have gotten your mobile app company funded with 10,000 downloads today. It's probably gonna take a few hundred thousand downloads and our strong, rapid adoption rate for a real financing to take place. So the definition of traction keeps changing. The environment gets competitive.

So that's why it's actually useful to look at angel list and see what companies just got funded, because that will give you an idea of what. Uh, and you can see that through a trending list through our feature lists and through our, um, uh, our done deals featured you can't see on this unit investor, it's again, the general solicitation law.

So there's a lot of privacy settings and controls, but, um, you can, you can see funding announcements as they come out and, uh, you can get a sense of how much traction these companies had. Okay, great. Yeah. So as angel list has started to grow, um, I'm sure there's been people that wanted to try to take a piece of that pie, whether it be patent trolls or, you know, somebody who's litigious coming out there.

So I'm just curious, what have you experienced like that? What could you share that could help us kind of, um, not have to go through side effects us personally. Yeah. Personally, it could be even, um, you know, people like recruiters trying to bypass your system, you know, plenty of people bypass the system, investors, recruiters, lawyers, companies.

How about it more power to you? Don't care. Um, you know, that's, that's what it means to be a platform, right? That's people do that on Craigslist. People do that on LinkedIn, go nuts. Um, as long as you got some value out of it, um, the patent trolls, luckily we have not been hit with yet. I don't think anything we're doing is patentable, let alone patented.

But the reality is that the patent examiners have allowed will have let a lot of stuff slip. Um, we don't make any money yet. So, you know, you're coming after an empty pile of empty box, so I don't know what you're going after, but, uh, maybe someday they'll come after us. I guess it's a, it's a mark of success, but we haven't been sued yet.

I do think the patent system isn't horrible needle. So that's a big problem. Entrepreneurs have, you're going to solve that one. Uh, you know, there's so many entrenched interests on the other side, uh, the intellectual ventures of the world now are still making money off of it. It's a really, and, and it's getting really scary, uh, with Google buying, Motorola mobility, 12 and a half billion for patents, apple, and Samsung, Samsung suing each other, the pattern oblivion, um, the, the good news is the incentives to solve it are now with apple and Google and Samsung and those big companies, because they're embroiled in so many patent lawsuits, they can't necessarily view it as a victory.

Um, they have a lot more influence than us and I, and I think in hope they'll get the law change, but then again, knowing big companies are going to change in a way that it benefits a big company. How does it need to be changed? You know, I think that there's just a phrase, uh, obvious to those skilled in the art that goes into granting a patent.

Like you're not supposed to get a patent on, I it's obvious to those skills. Um, and that just needs to be enforced, uh, and certainly software and business model patterns, you know, need to either not exist or just have a much, much higher bar maybe in this day and age of innovation, the timeframe for granted patent needs to not be 17 years, right?

Like what it was in 1800 and whatever, when they built the steam engine, it was 17 years. Maybe that made sense today. If you compress down it in at a time, it should be a lot, lot, lot shorter. Um, and there should probably be open review and feedback process. Uh, you know, they should probably work just a random idea of making one up.

Maybe every pattern should be thrown up on the internet and there should be an expert. Have one representative from each company and from each part of the ecosystem and there's hundreds of them and they vote on whether this thing is obvious or not. And that's it. And if it is, you don't get any credit, it should be a really high bar.

Sorry, build that. Be part of angel is all right. So a few last things, um, and then we'll get out of here. Um, so we you're our last one of the year, as I said, we're taking a much, much desired break in December. Um, in January though, we have a very strong lineup. We're going to have, um, Brian Chesky from Airbnb in San Francisco.

We're going to have Chad Dickerson of Etsy in New York who like never does things. And I've spent like six months twisting his arm to do this. So I'm incredibly glad. And then we're going to have someone who I think is one of the most exciting new entrepreneurs, Sophia Amorosa of nasty gal in LA, who will I think be our first woman that we've had.

Um, so an amazing lineup of three people whose businesses are actually all making ass, loads of money. Who've raised it billions of dollars in valuation. So, um, that'd be great month. Um, next year we have a lot of great people lined up. Um, drew from Dropbox, we have Phil Libin, um, mark Andreessen, city's doing it.

Dick costal is going to do it. Um, we're going to have a phenomenal lineup and we're really excited. Um, as you know, a lot of these will sell out really quickly. We're about to start opening up memberships for next year, which guarantees that you get in. Plus a lot of other benefits. It is also the reason that we don't completely go out of business doing these events and offering a $20 ticket.

Um, so if you have an expense account and you want to make sure you get into every event and help support the kind of journalism and events we do, we're going to be opening that up probably in the next week. So keep an eye out for that. Um, the other thing that keeps us from going out of business with doing events at a loss or sponsors, and as Noel said earlier, Braintree sponsored this one.

So if you enjoyed being here for free or cheap, um, it would be really nice if you think Braintree for paying for your ticket, uh, on Twitter or something like that. Um, so this brings us to the end. Yeah. Final two questions, um, that we always ask everybody. So the first is what is the one thing that you believe that very few other people believe?

Yeah. I don't know if this is all that rare of a belief in this audience, but, uh, I really firmly believe that the actual efficient size of a company is shrinking very rapidly. And so the future will be almost all startups. Like I think most of the world and most businesses will adopt the startup mentality in the sense that there'll be small companies, loosely connected and coupled to each other, almost through APIs or processes for their needs.

Um, the industrial revolution, uh, way back when, before I was born, uh, created this massive, uh, clustering effect where basically said there's economies of scale from having factories. And so everybody has a gang together and these 5,000, 10,000 person companies. And I think that trend has now reversed things to information technology.

And you could have a future where maybe your son or daughter will wake up in the morning and there'll be a message your phone or in their brain implant or Google glasses or whatever the heck it is. And they will have been assigned, you know, they'll have a couple of job offers, right that morning, they'll pick the one they want to do for the next two or three days.

They'll do that through a series of, uh, kind of APIs and interfaces the rest of the world, and then they'll get rated and they'll get a feedback. So in the future, we're all Uber drivers, right? Or we're all driving lifts around with pink mustaches or delivering people's food. Or I think the contract work trend is going to increase.

And I think the size of your average company is going to decrease. I think we're going to see more and more billion dollar businesses built by four or five people and it will stay at that. Um, and so I think that is one thing. For example, the venture capital industry does not believe, I think the venture capital industry still believes that you're going to have to put a couple of hundred million dollars into some company at some point to continue scaling it.

I don't think that's true. I think, uh, you will be able to break out and outsource pieces that today you don't think are outsourceable like you will be able to outsource your sales. You'll be able to outsource your revenue collection. You will be able to outsource your bookkeeping reconciliate. You'll ask, you may not outsource the final stage of your hiring, but you outsource the early stage of it.

So the, the, the there's gonna be lots and lots and lots of small companies loosely, coupled this is really bad news for all the people who were laid off in the last recession, because they don't think that way they are going to go and try and find jobs at big companies. And a lot of the jobs that are going to be created now are going to be at small companies, uh, which are going to require them to be more dynamic, more adaptable, more information savvy, uh, you know, a corollary to that is anybody who is comfortable with information technology today has a 10 X advantage in productivity or greater over someone who is not comfortable with, uh, information technology.

And so what you have is a phenomenon where it's, you know, everyone likes to say the richer, getting richer and income inequality, but I think the smart are getting richer and society doesn't know how to deal with this. And, uh, so literally, if you are someone who is good with computers, you can produce 10 times the output with someone who is working with their hands all day or a hundred times or a thousand, if you're Kevin.

Um, so given that, uh, he doesn't know what to do. We're not meant to handle those kinds of differences in productivity between individuals. And it's very hard to retrain the last generation. Um, but, uh, yeah, that's not the process. I think we're going to try and punish the rich and we're going to catch the smart in that dress.

And that's going to be an interesting dislocation. We won't see things like Facebook anymore. We're a company in eight years, goes from a handful of guys to thousands and a huge campus and sucking up as much talent. I think any entrepreneur worth their salt could today, bill Facebook would, if they, if they were building Facebook today and they had the same feature set they could do with a few hundred people.

Wow. It's just that if Facebook and Google are in the situation that large companies end up in where the founders know that 80% of the people in there are not really needed, they just don't know which 80% you can't identity. They're all lost now in the politicking. Yeah. You can't identify them. Yeah. The ratio might be different there, but, but you know, that's Maurice's job.

She's got to get in and clean house. You'll know she's doing her job. She fires a whole bunch of people. Well, we've said that since she was hired, she still hasn't done it. So she's trying to figure it out. She's trying to figure it out. Which chunk, how much of Yahoo do you think needs to be fired?

No, one's watching anymore. I haven't, you know, the truth is I haven't used Yahoo in a long time, so all of them, I know I just haven't used it. I don't even know what they do that much. I mean, there are parts of it that are pretty cool. Like the, the, there there's a marketplace product for Yahoo autos and Yahoo.

Finance is probably still the best finance site on the web. Um, but like, you know, we switched off Yahoo mail a long time ago, Yahoo search. What happened to it? Right. They go to being or something. Yeah. Um, so there's Yahoo just needs to figure out what businesses not in cut, all of those. Um, so Yahoo doesn't just need to fire people.

It needs to exit entire businesses and then focused on new set. Um, the future is all mobile. So yeah, he's got to get a better mobile, but saying you got a better mobile. It's like saying you gotta bet on tech. It's too broad. So you gotta, you know, so hopefully she won't come on and say, we're betting on mobile.

Like, okay. Yes, of course you're betting on mobile. What part of mobile? So if in the future, we're all working for small companies and you know, in some cases you're even your own contractor and your own startup it's, I mean, everyone has to work harder because people would start ups work a lot harder than people at big companies, but you were working at your way.

There's less bullshit, hopefully. Um, you're, uh, when you're doing it your own way, it doesn't feel like work to me. The definition of work is a set of things you have to do that you don't want to do. Um, by definition, if you want to do it, it's not work. That, that, that is literally the difference between working and leisure.

Like when you play video games, for example, when you're, you know, when you're, uh, raising cows and farm will and paying money to mark Pincus, right. And you're depositing coins into his, his wallet, uh, that's, that's a work, right? Farming is work. Why are you farming? But you don't consider it a word because you want to do it.

So that's the genius of Zynga looking so genius anymore. Um, okay. That, I would say that as a thing, many, many people I know do not believe so. So you've passed that one now. Mr. Ravi con what would be your mediocre soup? Yeah, this is a weird one. I tried to think about this. I couldn't come up with a great one.

Um, I think, uh, it's a mediocre superpower and you can interpret that a lot of ways, right? Like to, to someone who is obsessed with world domination, mediocre one might be, you know, continental domination, I guess. You're not going to go and get away with it 30 now. Um, yeah, my mediocre superpower, if this qualifies mediocre enough, would be having the ability to say no without feeling guilty.

And, uh, I kind of feel like, especially now with Angeles, we're in this position where we've sort of taken on the mantle of trying to help all the startups and you can't help all the startups. Most of them are not ready to be funded. Most of them do not deserve to be funded. You can't meet with them all.

They all want to meet with you. They all want personal time. They all want personal advice. Um, and you have to triage. And so you have to say no all day long. And when you say no, you just feel bad. Cause that's, you know, you're setting out to do the opposite. Um, and so I'd just love to be able to say no without feeling bad about it and make my day a lot easier.

I ended up in a lot of meetings there. I feel guilty. I get guilted into them, but I really don't want to be then meeting. I want to get out. Your solution could have been a way for you to say yes to everything. Would you just want to be let off the hook? Oh you, but that wouldn't be a mediocre superpower.

If you could say yes to everything, then that's a real superpower, I suppose, I suppose how many meetings? Cause you seem like a pretty blunt guy. I'm surprised you got guilty. No guidance ruthless about killing, uh, useless meetings. Uh, I own the domain. I don't do coffee.com. So the church for a while, I would say responses from Nepal that I don't do coffee.com, but that was too much of a jerk.

And I like coffee in San Francisco's great coffee. So, um, I still do a couple of meetings, but I really try and solve everything by email first, say, look, if it's, if it can be solved by email, let's do that because then you can help 30 companies in the same time period. You could have met one or if you can't do that, let's do a phone call.

And if he can't do that, then let's do a Skype. If you can't do that, let's do a meeting and let's bundle them together. There's four of them in one hour and just be very efficient, cut to the chase. And, uh, actually Hart tagger from YC told me this, that, you know, when he shortened the amount of time that he spent in office hours, um, it got way more efficient.

There was just, there's no time for someone to come in and kind of start doing the pleasantries. They know they have 15 minutes for the next guy walks in. So they're just more efficient. And I would say to start-ups like, don't spend your time doing meetings unless you really, really have to. I really think networking is over right.

Uh, there's all these articles about like, oh, you had a network more and this is how you, but it makes me want to vomit, right? Go do something great. And your network will instantly emerge if you build a great product, or if you get a good customer base, I guarantee you, we will get you funded. You will not have to go take internal meetings, building relationships, years in advance, uh, all that meeting stuff you're doing shaking hands, um, you know, do it for recruiting, do it to learn from really, really smart people.

But you gotta make sure you have something to offer them too. Otherwise you're just taking, but just sort of networking. If you're standing around an event with a name tag and a glass in your hand, and then that kind of includes this event. Not think about it, you know, it's sort of, you're doing it for entertainment.

You're doing it because that's your leisure time. This is, this is not your work time. This is your leisure time. Let's just be clear for those of you who told your coworkers, oh, I'm going to an important, no is not work. This is entertainment. If the beer and pizza didn't tip you off. I'm sorry to say. I'm not Lucy.

Kay. That wasn't fun. I was still very entertained. You're very kind. Thank you. Thank you very much for being our last guest of the year. And  .
