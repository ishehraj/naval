![[Ep 30 - Naval Ravikant - AngelList (1 of 2).mp3]]


Welcome to venture studio, episode 30 with Naval Ravikant founder of AngelList venture studio is the podcast where your host Dave Lerner entrepreneur angel investor in 60 plus companies and director of entrepreneurship at Columbia university interviews, the angel investors and venture capitalists who make up New York city's entrepreneurial ecosystem.

I am your producer, Kevin Weeks. Neval is the founder and CEO of AngelList. AngelList is the go-to platform for startups to raise money online, recruit employees and apply. Duvall and AngelList are on a mission to democratize the fundraising process. This interview is a big one, so we're breaking it into a two-parter make sure you subscribe.

So you don't miss part two. Remember all of our shows are on venture studio.org and on iTunes, SoundCloud, Stitcher tune in and on Google play for Android users.

Again, make sure you subscribe on iTunes and follow us on Twitter at venture studio to stay.

And now without further ado, let's head on up to the venture studio office with Dave Lerner and . Yeah.

Well, it's great to have you on how are you? I'm great. Thanks for having me too. It's a pleasure. Let's perhaps start with angel list. Most of my listeners know what angel list is and we've, we've covered it. But, uh, maybe for those who don't know, perhaps just catch them up on what angel has does and where you are today.

Yeah. It's a platform for helping founders, uh, with their most important tasks today, we help them raise money online and help them find talent online. Uh, we're the largest online fundraising planet. Uh, we've helped at this point, uh, probably about 900 companies raised money directly and a couple of thousand raise money indirectly through introductions that we've made to investors.

Um, the indirect or offline introductions led to some investment into companies like Uber and some tech and Postmates, uh, and online we've done companies like. And Sprague and make space inspire global and distill networks and HoneyBook, and, uh, many others. Um, we operate a network or we work with a network of hundreds of individual, high quality angel investors who are out there writing their own checks.

And we allow other people to sort of, uh, sophisticated other people to back them in the cloud with capital. And that brings more money into it. Financing ecosystem at the seed stage. Um, and, uh, on the recruiting side, we run on, what's probably now the largest startup recruiting marketplace. Uh, it's largely free.

We have 16,000 companies recruiting, almost half a million candidates, and we make about 20,000 mutual introductions, uh, Tinder style per week, uh, between candidates and, uh, companies. Um, so basically just trying to scale. Helping startup founders, uh, at the seed stage with their most important tasks.

Absolutely remarkable. Where, where you guys have come it's it's extraordinary. Thank you. Yeah. Give us a sense of the origins of Angeles. Maybe let's start there. How did this emerge? I know, I know you were blogging early. You were one of the early VC bloggers. Yeah. I was one of the contributors to venture blog early on, which was one of the possibly the first VC blog.

Uh, but then, uh, spun out and with my partner, Nivi, uh, we did venture hacks, which was all about educating entrepreneurs on the game theory of venture capital. And there was no master plan. I mean, it's, it's always easy to look back in hindsight and connect the dots, but, uh, we, uh, more to venture hacks towards angel list because people wanted help raising money, not just negotiating terms.

And, uh, in 2010, I was out there investing myself and it still just seemed like it was too hard for founders who weren't incredibly well-connected to meet VCs or seed funds. And so we want to democratize that a bit, make the process a little more transparent. And so we launched angel list, which started as a mailing list of people in startups and companies.

And then we slowly evolved that into both an online, online investing platform, uh, as well as this, uh, talent marketplace. Everyone listening. If you, if you haven't seen it, Finn venture hacks is still one of the best resources on the web. For any question you have, when people ask me questions like, uh, you know, how much equity should I give my advisor?

You go on venture hacks. And it's like, these are the different kinds of advisors. You know, this is the kind of equity apportionment you should think about, or it could even be co-founders sharing. I mean, it's any issue you can possibly imagine. Over those years, you guys really tried to. Documented and give people path or some parameters to contemplate.

Yeah. Th thank you. My, my co um, author actually, and probably the main author was Bubba Navy and he's an incredible writer. So he kind of wrote all of that down once. And then at some point we found when we were repeating ourselves. So that's when we also moved it on, but you can go get the venture hacks.

Uh, it's super cheap or almost free. And it's a PDF that basically has everything we ever wrote. And it answers everything from option pool to founding dynamics, to what venture capitalists mean when they say X, Y, Z, what are different terms mean? Which ones should you focus on? You know, a little bit of it is outmoded now.

Uh, but not all of it. And one of the things that I liked about that resource is that. Most, uh, of things that are out there written on the topic, uh, are written by someone who has a dog in the fight, right? So it's either a founder who maybe hasn't is raising a single round or two rounds. And hasn't seen tons of fundraising, or it's a venture capitalist who, even though they're trying to be helpful and objective to the founders, they're always going to have a subconscious bias towards the money side of the equation.

Um, so we, we tried to. Very founder-friendly, uh, but working across a large number of data points rather than just one or two, uh, and not being shrill or anti VC or anything like. That's right. It's right down the fairway. It gives you different ways of thinking about these issues. Other references, highly recommended, still cutting edge valuable for everybody.

So w you know, angel list has arrived. Uh, everyone in the ecosystem understands that. The, it sounds like the recruiting side of it, which I know less about us has also really scaled and the latest product, uh, that we've, we've covered twice before on this show is syndicates. And I want to dive into syndicates a little bit.

We've had, uh, Dustin Dolgan Al from maiden lane ventures. We've had Ming from CSC upshot, talk about syndicates from their perspective, but just to, to frame it up for people, how do you describe. Syndicates in the syndicate ecosystem. Yeah. So basically you have, uh, hundreds, maybe thousands of high quality.

What I call operator angels. These are angel investors out there, writing checks who are not full-time venture capitalists or seed fund managers. Uh, and they have good judgment, good insight. They don't do a lot of investments, but they usually invest in their friends, alumni, good founders entrepreneurs.

They've known for a long time, and they are the true backbone of early stage investing without them. I think in this market, uh, most venture capitalists will not invest in a company pre-product pre traction. Uh, Many pre-product market fit. So the pre-seed and the seed stages are heavily dominated by angel investors.

And so the problem with taking a check from an angel investor is a small check, right? It's 10 20, 25, K. It may not make, move the needle on, on a founder's financing. So it's syndicates ours, their pop-up venture funds on demand, uh, using the power of the internet and aggregating capital and, and, uh, email.

It's kind of stuff and technology to give angel investors, a larger pool of capital to invest when they're going to invest. So for example, if you have a colleague who is starting a company, you know, the person's a great engineer or a founder, you want to back them. Normally you might write a 10 or $25,000.

Now using syndicates, you can pull in your friends, other angels, institutional capital. We can make it happen for you very quickly within a week to two weeks. And you can read a $250,000 check or 50 $500,000 check. Um, and we're, we're evolving it to is, uh, you know, favoring, uh, what we call backers, you know, like Kickstarter backers who are not just sophisticated, but also evaluate.

So there's the lead angel who writes their initial check, sends the signal, does the diligence and is responsible for the investment. Uh, but then there's a bunch of backer angels. Some of whom can be called upon, uh, for their local expertise. Um, and it's also a very open marketplace for sophisticated investors in funds.

So you talked to Dustin and Ming and they both run large funds. Dedicated to exclusively investing through Angeles backing angel syndicates, and working through this network of hundreds of operator angels, um, who are doing deals out there. Um, and, and from the founder side, it allows them to choose the angel that they want to work with, uh, rather than having to take the capital from the person that maybe they don't want to work with as much.

Um, I've always called venture capital as a bundle, and it's a bundle of, of advice control. Um, and so you kind of have you've historically had to purchase that bundle, but I think smart founders now are starting to unbundle that, and they're saying I'm going to get, uh, advice from my best advisor. Uh, and I'm going to get money, uh, from, I can put the money behind that advisor as opposed to having to get it from someone else.

Maybe whose advice I don't love as much. And who comes packaged with control provisions that I don't know. Um, so there's, uh, you know, smart founders are becoming more picky about how they assemble their financing, uh, as opposed to just taking it, uh, you know, under one brand one bundle. Right. Right. I love it.

The, the unbundling that you've referred to often, and this is a theme you've mentioned democratization, you've mentioned unbundling. We're going to come back to that. Yeah. And, and actually as syndicates it's pop-up venture funds today, but we're also using. Uh, as an infrastructure firm, there are larger VCs or using syndicates.

They use it, uh, to either bring in community of angels or Scouts that they want to work with. Uh, they use the infrastructure also to bring in their own investors, limited partners into very large deals, uh, that are opportunity vehicles. So if you're a small fund and you've got a large allocation in a company, Uh, too big for you, but you have access.

Um, you can bring, you can use syndicates to bring in your LPs, your limited partners into that deal, uh, on a one-off kind of basis. So, uh, underneath on a technology level, what we have is a very flexible infrastructure for creating one-off venture funds, tracking, reporting accounting, uh, collecting money, handling distributions, uh, handling data and all of that kind of stuff.

So we were playing around with that to sort of reassemble. The parts of the venture business that should be done on a one-off basis as opposed to on this 10 year committed fund basis. W where are you in terms of scale now with this new product, which is probably about two years old, I'm sure. Yeah. It's a little over two years old.

Uh, we're moving about $200 million a year through syndicates. Most of it is through individuals still, uh, institutional capital probably accounts for about 20%. Uh, although that's scaling, that's changing rapidly as more and more institutions discover it. And it starts to generate returns. Uh, We have about 200, uh, operator angels, uh, you know, who do a couple of deals a year.

There are a few people who do a lot more deals and they get a lot more of the press and obviously more professional about it. But, uh, essentially it's a, it's a fairly one. Set of people who have done syndicates. Um, we've got, uh, about half a billion dollars in committed capital from institutions now that, uh, deploys exclusively behind syndicates.

And we expect to bring on more. Uh, we have a tremendous infrastructure, uh, Uh, doing these deals, we'll probably do about 50 of them every month right now. And we turn away, we turn away hundreds. Uh, it's an all carry model. There's no management in the fees right now. So, uh, and there's a lot of alignment.

The average syndicate lead puts in 16% of the round themselves, which is much higher than any general partner commitment and a VC firm. Uh, and because they're getting no management fees as true skin in the game, uh, and they also bring in, as I said, the bulk of their capital from, uh, individuals angels.

All of whom we bet for not just accreditation, which is the legal threshold to have to be rich. Uh, but also sophistication. They have to understand how risky angel investing is, how opaque and illiquid these assets are, how long the timeline is and what are you doing to seed that ecosystem to, to allow it to flourish?

What kind of stuff are you doing beyond this? Yeah, we try to stay very invisible, both thin and neutral as a platform. We're not self promotional you'll you don't see us buying ads or, uh, having a lot of brand. Um, so really our, our job is to be a facilitator and a platform to make things easy for the operator angels and for their backers and for the institutions that want to do these investments.

And of course, we're the founders. Um, so we'll get involved in mediating if there's a difficult situation, but mostly our job is to build software, build operations and keep our heads down. Um, for investors who. Don't necessarily want to go through all of the difficulty and the insight of having to pick deals online.

Uh, and also, you know, a lot of the best deals are so-called best deals or self-perceived best deals in this business. Uh, like to be in stealth mode of they're private. So right now, two thirds of our deals are running in privacy mode on private mode. Um, and that's, you know, that's been happening more and more recently.

So like last year, it might've at this time, it might've been a third. Uh, the beginning of this year is probably about half. Now. It's close to two thirds. Um, and especially as we get institutional capital on and more and more VCs on more and more of these deals are running privately. Uh, and so for a small investor on the platform, they might not know how to get access to all of these deals or how to evaluate all of these deals.

So as a service for them, we run these, uh, uh, online basically investment funds where you can put in a $25,000. We'll split it across a hundred or more, uh, blue chip angel investments for you. And we don't charge anything extra for that. That's kind of a free service and you can just find that at angel.co/funds.

Um, so it's, it's basically the first diversified high quality. Uh, investment funds for seed stage angel investing. Um, but you can put money into, obviously it's a very risky asset class. Obviously it's very opaque and illiquid and you know, w it's a tiny percent of your net worth that should go in there.

And it's a very long cycle, but if you want exposure to Silicon valley, New York, Boston, LA Austin, Seattle, uh, London Tel Aviv, the blue chip angel deals coming out of there, uh, at the very early stage, you know, it's, it's, uh, it's a good way to get exposure to that asset rather than having to wait for those companies to go public 10 years later.

Right. And there's a wealth of syndicates available in different verticals and different regions and different personalities involved. The folks, uh, like maiden lane and CSC upshot that actually backs some of the syndicates. What, what are you, uh, uh, comfortable talking about? I mean, what are you thinking about doing in that arena?

In some ways you can think about it as for the, the angels that are, are doing syndicates of their own on angel list. The investors, I have one myself, um, these funds are completely dedicated to. Uh, backing syndicates themselves. And you currently have two, are there going to be more in the future? What are your plans there?

Yeah, there are more, we're onboarding a couple more. Um, there'll be a fairly limited set because these funds have access to a lot of sensitive information, uh, from the raising company. So they're under strict NDA and we just can't have that many of them. Uh, but we have a couple more of these large funds in flight.

Um, I'm not ready to announce anything but states. There will be more. Okay. That's good to know. These are kind of like seats on an exchange. There's going to be a limited number of seats on this exchange. So yeah, for awhile. That's right. Uh, so these are, these are large institutional funds that have currently dedicated and committed half a billion and more is coming.

Uh, it exclusively backing the top operator angels on syndicates as they do deals. Uh, and we also have family offices, uh, and very wealthy individuals, um, who are, you know, think of them as sort of the whales, um, who are, who are committing as well to put in care capital behind syndicates in exchange for access to more deals and more leads.

Right. Um, so you even recently, for example, we. No, we have a lot of very rich people on the platform who are right now investing small amounts and playing around and testing. And as they become more comfortable and more happy with some of their investments, they dedicate more and more. Um, for example, there's a great little, uh, venture fund slash family office, uh, out of Brussels, uh, that started using angel lists, uh, back in the day when we were just a minute.

Yeah. They met some good companies. Then when we launched syndicates, they started back in some syndicated deals. Uh, and recently it is announced, uh, that they're not going to be doing anywhere direct investments. Everything's going through syndicates and they're putting all of their family office, uh, private investing through syndicates.

Um, and you know, they've dedicated $11 million just recently to this. Uh, and that's just, that's just. You know, one, one group of two individuals who've, uh, three individuals have decided to go in and we've got thousands of these. So yeah, over time, it'll scale up as people become more comfortable with the model.

Uh, and then I think also as people started using it, they realized like, oh, this is, you know, I can put in a $5,000 behind a good company online, uh, without having to do, you know, yes, I have to pay Carrie to the lead investor. You have to pay a 20% carry on average 20%. Um, but that saves me from having to do, to move to Silicon valley hunt down the deal, get access, figure out how to add value and track the company in detail.

And this business that's a bargain because this business is normally full of financial middlemen, taking management fees and carry and layers upon layers upon layers. So getting direct access to these early stage deals for a, for a percentage of the profits is a very reasonable sort of where to go. So I think they are comfortable with that Mo.

They, they play with it for awhile and they check the deal quality and make sure they're generating returns and getting into deals are being marked up by good venture capitalists. And you can see all of that at, at angel.co/done-deals sort of done deals page, and you'll see all the deals that have been done in the platform recently that are public and can be announced.

And you can see which ones have been marked up by VCs. And you can see what angel this went in and you can see that we've already had our syndicate graduates have gone on to raise. Close to $2 billion from VCs after syndicates. And that's only in three years. Yeah. So it's, you know, it's been a very short period of time, but there's still a huge follow-ons available.

Th th th I can see those bunch of people dipping their toe in, and now they're coming in much heavier. Yeah, exactly. You'll have to create a sub domain called angel.co/whale at some point to accommodate see, like our class of 2013. I mean, we're a platform. So the index is always going to be of a very inclusive.

Uh, but that's why these funds exist. So maiden lane and CSC, upshot, and R and R funds at angel.co/funds. These are more professional. We manage where people, uh, who are managing them go in, they pick what they think are the best. But even if you wanted to do that, even if you're just to look at the index of how things would do.

Um, we're already starting to show, um, you know, positive, but, uh, very positive, but unrealized returns from our early classes. I, so it's really, it's really evolving quickly. Uh, w what are some of the speed bumps? One I can, uh, mention is obviously, you know, people being concerned about privacy. You have, uh, you have.

Yeah. The entrepreneurs who you approach and say, well, you know, I'd like to invest in, maybe I do a syndicate, uh, w w with your funding and they, and those that are not too familiar yet with the platform, they say, well, explain syndicates me, explain it to them. Yeah. How do I know that that information is not getting out to my competitors?

You know, how, how do you know if there's 50 people in your syndicate? You know, are they going to be talking about the company and loose lips at cocktail parties? This is out in the, in the air as I'm sure you know how to think about it in a couple of ways. Most companies these days, you know, you are, before you can raise money, you have to build your product and launched it.

So you're, you're not really in true stealth mode, but if you companies are in true stealth mode and in my experience, the stealthier the company early on sort of the lower, the more insecurity the founder is signaling. Some companies should be a stealthy, but not all in fact, most companies should not. So I think the whole meme is a little over.

And if you go to the Y Combinator demo day, or you look at how companies launch in tech crunch or product hunt, they're screening for attention. So it's almost the opposite, right? You go to, you go to YC demo day and you stand up in front of a thousand investors and, you know, Tom, everything. Uh, and those are people who are not even serious about necessarily investing in this company.

Maybe it's the, a few of them will. Well, that's true with any accelerator or with any one of these conferences that the launch conference or tech or tech crunch disrupt. So I think first, I would say that the whole stealth meme is sort of going away for most companies. Not for all. There are some who will always need it and require it and benefit from it.

Uh, the second. Uh, the, the syndicates themselves run in different modes with different levels of curation. So it gets a little confusing, but we have some leads who have, you know, 500 backers. And essentially if you're raising money for one of those syndicates, then don't reveal anything that, that that's selfie.

You can tell the lead in. And the backers can choose whether to follow the lead or not, but the lead's not going to convey anything you're not comfortable conveying. So treat that just as if your information is public, that's a smart thing to do. And there are other cases where my syndicate, for example, it's very curated.

Um, I only take on backers who are very sophisticated that I know and they're underwriting. Uh, and if they, if they violate that, then you know, I'll kick them off at the very least and probably take more action. And there's very sh and I have a queue at its smallest set of backers. And then there are the institutional funds like maiden lane and CSE shut up, shut we're under complete NDA.

So that's no different than the LPs and your VC fund. Uh, so generally I would say, you know, number one, uh, Yeah, don't reveal anything that you would be unhappy if it got on the front page of the New York times, that's just good business in general. Um, when you're getting introductions to VC seed funds and angels, your deck is being melded on any way.

You're foolish. If you're putting things in that deck that your competitors can use in any meaningful way. Um, that's, you know, that's one number two is it's hard enough to get attention in this world, right? From anyone investors or whoever. So we find it. Actually companies that are less stealthy do better because they get interest from, there are lots of VCs who are watching the Angela syndicates platform.

So when a deal goes out and it's more of the open side of the company will get pinged by VCs. Uh, and also VCs will know that, okay, this company is out there in the space, so the space is getting competitive. So they're less likely to find one of your competitors that comes in later. So a lot of companies actually prefer to use syndicates just to get the word out, like, Hey, we're here for.

We're already in the space. If you're funding a competitor, you're already behind the curve. And then lastly, I would say, you can also just tell your syndicate lead, Hey, I want to do a private deal. Uh, and I want to make sure that none of the backers are going to leak. So, uh, you know, make sure you've picked good backers that, you know, well, uh, and like I said, our institutional funds, uh, can always provide a lot of capital into the good deals.

And then. You know, they are under massive NDA. They, they would get kicked off the platform and lose their funds if they violated it. Yeah. So, so there's a lot of stuff that we have built around privacy. We're going to be doing more and more. Actually another two thirds of the deals on the platform are private.

Anyway. Um, you're going to see us making more and more changes that clearly reflect how private the platform is. Uh, we, we, we are also having a lot of, uh, syndicates being done between VCs and their LPs. And those are of course completely, fully locked down private, um, using our infrastructure. So it to a casual observer, who's looking at Angeles, they might think of the syndicates volume is slowing down because they're seeing less and less deals that are kind of open to the casual observer.

But actually the number of deals has gone up quite a bit. Um, it's just that most of them are being done privately between the lead and their selected backers, as well as between the lead and our institutional fi fund partners. Um, w where this eventually. Is you're going to be looking at the, the ideal of good we'll have the lead plus it'll have 10 to 20.

Value added mentor class backers, right. And each one may have some different expertise. Like I've got a really good engineer. Who's good at scaling. I've got someone who's good at growth hacking. I've got someone who's good at finance. Uh, I've got someone who understands real estate rights. You've got a bunch of people in, uh, in the backing that work almost as lightweight mentors, um, available through the lead for a phone call or a meeting, if you need help in that particular area.

And the bulk of the funds will come from institutional. Okay. You know, the bulk of the invested money in the world that comes from institutional capital and the institutional capital. They're not quite passive, but they're more passive investors. So they're, they're, they're more like limited partners investing in a VC fund, uh, and less like individuals who, uh, you know, you're going to be talking to, or having to deal with.

Right. Um, so, uh, my, my colleague Parker Thompson sum this up really well, where he just said, uh, you know, the farmers startup L Jackson. So he has a, he has a way of putting things in a pithy way. Uh, you know, 10 people I can call on for help and one person, uh, to sign the document. And do you think funds will eventually, uh, use Angeles completely, uh, as their backend?

I mean, traditional venture funds, uh, that I do not know. Um, partially, uh, right now pretty unlikely. We are doing micro funds to these small funds for a very high quality angels who just are getting more professional about it. Uh, and they want to be able to. Um, a large and they want to be able to write small checks.

They want to be, to write checks without having to go back and run a syndicate each time. So we are running what we call these angel funds and they're small like million dollar angel funds, um, for, for these kinds of leads. And, uh, so those are starting to creep into what, uh, normally a seed fund would look like, but because we have not really rolled out management fees, uh, we, we haven't really gone down that road.

The truth is like, if someone wants to be a dedicated full-time nonsense, Investor investor. Um, they're probably going to go get a bunch of limited partners, uh, big institutions, and those limited partners will have highly custom requests and requirements. Uh, and those will create a custom product which really doesn't work well with our scalable online model.

Um, but what we're also finding is that people dip their toes and they start doing a few in. And the beauty of syndicates, unlike normal venture fund is you can keep adding backers throughout the normal venture fund. You open the venture fund and then you raise some money. Then you close it for four or five years.

Whereas in our model, because every deal sets up a separate little vehicle underneath, you can keep adding backers all day long. Uh, and so people started out dipping their toe in the water with, you know, maybe 20, 30, $50,000 of backing per deal. And now there are many individuals in the platform who has 500, $700,000 of backing per deal.

The equivalent of that in a fund model is a 20, $25 million. Yeah. So just through individuals and just without that much effort, you sort of slid a 20, $25 million fund that can keep growing. So at that point, why move off and do a venture fund? Right. Um, so I think over time, for example, we may add a management fee model for some of these top leads, but they're going to need a serious track record before anyone's going to commit to paying the management fees.

Yeah. And there was one thing about our model that is quite different than the traditional venture model, because each deal is separate because each backward can opt in or opt out of every deal. The quid pro quo to that is that the economics, the carry on each deal are calculated on each deal. They're not calculated.

They're not edit it out across all the deals that lead has done because there's a different set of backers. Anyway. So, if you had the same backers, you could net it out before you paid them the profits, but because there's a different backward base in every single deal, you actually cannot net it out. Um, so it's a quid pro quo and we've tried to model we've actually said, do you want

For example, these angel funds that I was talking about, these little angel funds, those have net net carry. Uh, but then in those ones in exchange, the backers are locked into all the deals. So the flexibility that the backers want, we find the backers want the flexibility. Means that the leads get deal by deal carry.

So what we do is there, they, they get less carry on average, they get 15 set, a normal 20. Um, they have, or actually normally receive is more like 25. Um, they have to put in their own capital, their own skin in the game to show that they're, you know, that they're taking a risk here and they lose money if they lose.

Uh, and they're not getting management fees. So luckily paid regardless of the outcome. Um, so we have all kinds of checks and balances to work with that. Uh, but the advantage of that to the least. You don't have to wait 10 years until you're every investment you've ever made returns money to the LPs. You could have one hit early on.

For example, we had two different syndicates in the company cruise, which was recently sold to GM at a billion dollar valuation. And we had two different syndicates and two different rounds. And the leads on those got paid. Right. So the company exited, they got cash. So we trade off. We basically say, you're not going to get that guaranteed management fees is not a salary job.

Where are you going to be sitting around and just money? But if you find a good company right, and exits early and you make, and you make money for your investors, you get paid right there. You don't have to wait 10 years until every day. You are invested in the business, gets paid back.
