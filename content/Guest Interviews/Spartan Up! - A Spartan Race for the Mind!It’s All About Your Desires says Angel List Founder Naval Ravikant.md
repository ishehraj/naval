Okay. Uh, welcome back Spartan up podcast. We have the Joe de Sena, the Colonel NAI, the Sephora Alexandra, and the Johnny Wayne with Ms. Marian and Andrea behind us. Um, we have Nevada rabbit con this week, uh, the founder of angel list, which is what, what is it? Well, we're going to find out what that is.

Great question. Super, super smart guy, like off the charts. Smart. And if you don't get something. Probably should stop listening to the podcast. Perfect. All right, let's go see if you're smart enough to watch the pocket. We want subscribers. So that's the way we survive here. We don't take subsidies. We have no sponsors.

So, so please get out there and share this. That's how we get ahead and are able to feed. All right, let's go with angels

smarten up podcast in Malibu and Navarro rabbit con the founder. Uh, did I say that right? Close enough, close enough. The founder of angel list, which is a giant business. I mean, global. Yeah. What kind of a website that helps startups? Raise money, find talent, and find customers and started that in 2002. Re, uh, side project more built it up as a business starting 2013.

Now we have got, uh, tens of thousands of startups in the platform over a thousand that have raised money. Uh, we've got, uh, 10,000 that have hired. We've got millions of people on there looking for jobs. Uh, and we also have a product, a property called product time, two, which basically helps companies launch to their customers.

So, um, with me, I there's no plan on these pockets. We, we just start going down a certain. What's interesting. What I just heard was you have had the opportunity to talk to a lot of potential startups. What's the diff what would you say the key differences are between success and failure? Like what, what does one startup have versus.

That doesn't make it have a luck is a big one. Timing is everything, but you kind of make your own luck, you know, if you stay at it long enough. So I see entrepreneurial efforts often fail the good entrepreneurs don't fail because they stay at it. Uh, I don't believe in this model where, uh, you basically pick something and do, and then you struggle at it your entire life.

I think. A lot of life is about finding what you're meant to do uniquely. I mean, the common rhetoric's of human DNA are staggering. You've got 7 billion people on this planet. You're never going to meet any two people who have been vaguely alike and can substitute for each other. So every human being is unique and what you're going to be amazingly good at is the thing that you do for fun.

The thing that you're passionate about, no one can compete with you on something that you find entities. Right. No matter how much hard work they put in. Cause cause for you, that's not work. Uh, I consider the definition of work to be the set of things that you have to do that you don't want to do. And if you like what you do, then it's not as hard work.

All right. But, but, uh, even if you really love what you're doing and it's not work, you've got to, I still have to get on a computer all day and answer 600 emails, even though I love. Yeah. So you, when I say like, uh, you know, if you, there's the old saying, like, if you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life.

It's a little exaggerated, it's more aspirational. Of course, there's all kinds of things you're going to have to do that you don't necessarily want to do in the short term, but it's for a greater cause for a mission that you believe in. But I would say definitely, you know, this all comes out of desire.

We want certain things. We make sacrifices to get those things. You can basically get anything you wanted to life, as long as it's one thing, that's my learning. If you want to be rich, you can be rich. You're going to spend your entire life trying to be rich. That's all going to work on. You want to be happy.

You can spend your entire life being happy. You'll get it. That's what you'll work on. Um, the problem happens when we have multiple desires. When we have fuzzy desires, when we sort of want to do 10 different things and we're not clear about which is the one that we care about. So I would argue the great point, right?

Because, um, you want to have a happy family life. You want to be rich. Um, and I want to be happy. Yeah. Can't have everything, everything. Yeah. I would suggest that you basically pick one fervent desire that you have above all else and find a way to reach that desire where it doesn't feel like work. You enjoy the thing that you're doing so much and on a general high level of basis that it won't feel like work then you'll out-compete everybody else.

I think most of life. Searching. It's not about doing people spend too much time doing and not enough time thinking about what they should be doing. Um, like for example, finding your spouse, right? The way we treat it is we start dating somebody and then we're like, oh, it's not working out. Maybe I should go into therapy.

Maybe I should try harder. And it's a round peg square hole. But the reality is now there's 7 billion people in the world. There's dating sites everywhere. You'll probably meet a total of a hundred thousand people in your life. You're barely scratched. So spending time in a relationship that's not working, struggling to make it work is wasted time.

It's a Google search. You just hit the back button and try the next result. And technology enables that. I think that's true of work. Also, you know, you grow up saying you just instantaneously as created, created 1 million divorces possibly, but then in the future of credit, 1 million stable marriages, right?

So it's the angel you need the angel. Of dating. I mean, Tinder is out there, right. And there's a bunch of others out there. There's not the only one, but it's a good one. Um, but I, in general, I don't believe any more in this model of struggle. I believe in a model of flip. It's funny. I have another, I assume you're from India.

Yes. Long time I have, um, my best friend is Indian and. Him and I battle over Spartan cause everything is about struggle, fight and going to Roscoe's and he's always like, why does it have to be that way to avoid a company? Yes. Warriors are the ones who find it fun. You know, it's like jock over like, you know, like that's his life, that's where he lives for.

Let's say if I were trying to compete with that, I would lose horribly. So I go back to this idea that most of life is a search for who and what needs you the most and who and what you need the most. And when you find that fit, it just, you find it. Just keep looking it'll fit. Just lots of data points.

You know, it's like you're sitting on a couch right now, back up 10, 15 years ago, you're sitting on a couch and you don't know what you want to do with your life. So for the person out there, how do they big struggle? I think for everybody, there is something that they. That other people think is work, but it's effortless for them.

Their friends will basically say to them like, oh, I can't believe you can just do that without hating it. Right. Everyone's got something like that. Right. And whatever that thing is, you can build a career out of that. That's the beauty of being such a large planet, because if you're that good at it, You probably love it.

And you're going to be in, you're going to be better than anybody else because you'll be doing it for fun when they're doing it for work. And eventually they'll tire out when the results aren't there and they'll give up. And a lot of the results. Now, the world is a very efficient place, right? There's lots of podcasters.

There's lots of runners. There's lots of TV shows and lots of writers world is very efficient. So the people who succeed are the ones who are irrationally passionate about something. So they're not doing it for the. But you just need to be patient. This is the problem. It takes 10 years to build a career in anything it takes.

It takes 10 years to minute to raise a child. It takes 10 years moving from build a business. It takes 10 years to build a career. I think you're awesome because, um, I I've built three main businesses in my life. Each one of them, I didn't get paid for about eight years. Right. And so people will say you're crazy, but I feel like it's about an eight or 10 year thing.

Yeah. Because the world's inefficient place. There are no get rich quick schemes. If you see a, get rich, quick scheme that somebody else trying to get rich off of you. Right. That's a good one too. You like. I tweet a lot. Twitter forces me to gather my thoughts, 40 characters, right? Exactly. I hope you're not sitting still while you listen, you better get a burpee break.

You are definitely going to want to join us next week. This is one of Johnny's a really good buddies. He's just coming back from this Arctic expedition racing. Considered one of the greatest explorers, our time, a Canadian, a like you Johnny. So how can they make sure they're not going to miss us? Well, I'll tell you, you don't want to miss any of our episodes, but especially this one, what you want to do, whether you're listening on iTunes or watching on YouTube subscribe, then you'll get notifications more importantly, share, tell everyone you know about this great show.

Thanks so much for being part of our mission. We're trying to rip people off the coach change lives. You can be part of that. Thanks so much. So let's apply your learnings, um, w with angel list. To somebody out there starting a business. Yeah. So angel, this was somewhat an action. I didn't have history. I just started as a business.

I started as a labor of love. It started as venture hacks, which was in it, which was educating entrepreneurs on how to raise venture capital. Then angel. This was just a list of angels that they could reach out to. And then it sort of grew into a business. So it wasn't intentional in that sense, it was just a public service that kept getting bigger and bigger.

And there's a day when the demand for their public service would disappear. And I'm not going to be torn up. I mean, obviously I want to do well for my investors and people working with me. Um, but I, I will flow to something else in life. Life is big and it's a big universe out. There's a lot to do. I try not to have expectations of what I'm doing next or where things are going to go, because then you close yourself off to the opportunities that the universe is constantly dropping all around.

It's just, you have to go pick them up and you have to be aware enough to notice them. And when, if you're too single-minded with your desires, you're not going to notice new opportunities to grow that are emerging. Right. It is true. Right. I'm thinking back as you say that to the neighborhood I grew up in.

Yeah. Right. Our minds want to keep it exactly as it was with the same people, but the reality is I go back to them. It's a different place, completely different place. I don't even want to be there. Right. And in fact, like the worst thing that could have happened to you was if you'd gotten all the desires, if everything you wanted in life had actually happened, you'd be living in your hometown and be married to your high school, sweetheart.

You'd be doing your first job, but you'd be the boss that Dunkin donuts or whatever your first job was. Right. Right. So you ha so the, the world doesn't always give you what you want, but it often gives you what you. And for that, you just have to be willing to accept that. Yeah. Maybe this is not the right place, the right time for me, and I just need to move on and that's the patient.

Flow. I would call it just flow. Patients is hard. I'm not the most patient person either. So these are some notice. There was a few minutes. We had to wait for the podcast because life is short. I'm dying every minute at a time. Right. And so you we've been dead for 13 and a half billion years. That's a lie.

That's how long from the big bang till now universal would be around 70 billion. You around for 50, 70, a hundred years a year, it's a blink of a Firefly in the night, one time, right? You're just barely here. So you gotta make the most of every minute, which doesn't mean that you chase some stupid desire for your entire life.

What it means is that like every second that you have on this planet, it's very precious. It's your responsibility to make sure that you're happy and you're interpreting everything in the best possible way. Happiness could be, could be. I'm just going to go drink all day at the bar. That's pleasure.

That's not happiness. One of these bad words, and I'm almost sorry to bring it up because it's an overloaded word. It's like, it's like friendship or love. It could mean anything to anyone. Uh, to me, uh, happiness is an internal trait that comes out of being peaceful and accepting of whatever is going on around you.

Uh, it's that sense that nothing is missing in this one. Right. So if you have the sense that something is missing in this moment, AKA, a desire that will pull you out of this moment and will make you unhappy. Our natural state is to be happy. If a child is unhappy, you say what's wrong. If an adult is really happy, you say, why are you happy?

Right. It's a little weird. So I think we're born with happiness. We're intrinsically happy creatures, but we become unhappy because our egos create desire. The desire pulls us out of the model. So something is missing right now. And then we chase that and then we wonder why we're unhappy. And then we try to drown that sense of loss out through pleasure and pleasure.

It comes through drugs, drinking, partying, sex, whatever. Could even be extreme sports. It's all just trying to forget ourselves. Um, and I think there are ways past, we got the, I got the, um, these extreme sports, uh, problem guy and we all have it. I mean, looking for ways different, get to ourselves because we often are our own worst terrorists we're own worst task masters.

We're always arguing with ourselves, disciplining ourselves. Uh, wanting things then not wanting to want things, you know, fantasizing about things, regretting things. It's this constant monkey mind loop that's running in your head. That's why now meditation is invoked because people are starting to realize like, maybe that's not how I'm meant to live.

That's not how I meant to survive, you know, 300 years ago. And even, even forget Trinity, five years ago, pre smartphone, seven years ago, you weren't constantly being pulled out. Your present reality into your phone and be like D D this constant little addiction. We're like pigeons now. And B of Skinner's experiments, you know, pressing little levers to get dopamine hits.

Um, so we've been reduced to that, and it's really important to be cognizant of, uh, first you get to a peaceful state where you feel like nothing is missing and I'm okay with this moment. Then you can add your desires one by one that's, um, a hard state for most. Right. I mean, that's the challenge. It is a challenge because we have unconsciously been led there through desires that we copied from other people, most of our desires are picked up through society.

What other people are doing, what my friends are doing, what my brother's doing, what my classmates are doing, what my wife wants, et cetera. So we copied those desires and then we make them part of ourselves and we drive forward drive forward. But really what do you really. I think deep down, nobody is doing it for themselves.

Deep down, everyone thinks they're fighting for a cause or they're helping out some downtrodden person or it's for their family or whatever. But when it comes down to what you actually need, you need a little bit of food, a little bit of water, a little bit of place to put your head. Right. Well, I say all the time, I'm not crazy.

I'm with the smartest guy on the planet right now. And I'll tell you what, when I started doing these crazy races, right. It became clear one day I was like, this is the most peaceful place ever, because all I want is water, food, and shelter right now. I don't want anything else. I'm not chasing. I just want water, food shelter.

And I, I couldn't really describe why that was so peaceful, but you just nailed it and that's what everybody wants. And then that's it. And they get away from that. Exactly. Right. We create these constructs of desire that we copy from each other on top. It's really important to sit down sometime close the door.

Turn off the lights and just sit there by yourself and watch your mind. Not even judge, it don't even argue with it. Don't even fight it. Just watch the thing run out of control. Your mind is like a monkey. That's running around flinging feces and throwing bananas everywhere. It's impossible to control and ask, how did I become like that?

Because when you were a child, you weren't like that. Look at any two year old. They're not like that. They live very much moment. They don't have constant uncontrollable thoughts about the past or the future. And that's what keeps them happy. So how can you unconditionally. Things that you don't want any more running through your head it's possible, but it's different for everybody.

You're awesome. Thank you. Do you guys get enough out of that? Cause um, you're going to have to watch this three or four times. Not at all. Do you have any big books or anything? People should know? I'm mostly on Twitter as at nibble at an Ava L guy that to two podcasts with Tim Ferris. Um, yeah, but Twitter is probably the best way to kind of keep following.

Yeah. Cool. We're going to have you out at a Spartan race. Thanks for fitness water, food and shelter. I'll have to live my own. Thank you. Thank you. So that blew me away. Uh, honestly. That one was like drinking from a fire hose. That guy just point after point nails things one after another, a little business.

Yeah. You all are standing next to him. He said there was no waste of time. Yeah. But, but so chill about it. Like, you know, you got some guys Robbins that are went up like a top. This guy just drops wisdom after wisdom. So, so his whole thing, this whole angel list, um, I, I love how he said that it didn't start out as a business.

It started out sort of as a, as a passion project, just something that he was doing, that it evolved into really filling a need and actually turned into a pretty enormous, but that happens a lot. I mean, that's how Spartan happened, right? I mean, any business to his point where you. There's no business where you're not going to put in all your time for a decade.

Yeah. It better be something that you love. It better be a passion project. If it's not your yeah. Well, that's what he said. It is going to take that long to be successful. And if you're not enjoying it, what'd he say? He says that the business hasn't a failed entrepreneur fails, right?  yeah. Although he said, he said a true entrepreneur won't fail.

They'll eventually find the thing that they're good at that they enjoy doing. Cause that's what it's going to take to get there to the finish line. Right. Everyone is unique, right? Everybody's got their own set of DNA. So there's seven. On the planet. Every one of those people are no two are the same. So each has its unique abilities.

Its traits, its strengths, its weaknesses. Find your strength and play to that. Strength is what you need to do to become successful slash happy. Yeah. Um, and any talked about. How pleasure doesn't equal happiness. That's right. It's sleeting. Right. So I guess the pleasure is, as we would think of just a quick pleasurable moment, whereas he's talking a much greater happiness in life and spirit and mindset and the resident is a little Buddhist.

Oh yeah. He was very, he was, he didn't seem that way, right? Yeah. I mean, you're right. He just, he was a very succinct speaker who had his, his thoughts. Uh, he, he talks about that. He's got a twin. And he's learned to think. He probably has always thought that way, but that is that's enhanced visibility. And he just says, it says, it says it guys, some of us meet you, you know, we start talking and hopefully find something along the way, but he already knows that added time.

Bullet bullet, bullet bullet, and then make your own luck. Part of that. I love that. He said it when he put it in context, he said, the universe is 13.5 billion years. Old. Humanity is a hundred thousand years old. Uh, you're going to be here for 70 years. He said, it's the blink of a Firefly. I've heard it called a fart in a fan factory, but the idea is you were here for such incredibly short period of time.

Make the most of it, enjoy every second of it. But that's what you say about his efficiency comes from. I'm only here for seven years, I'm going to get stuff done. I had seen him an hour after we did the podcast. He was walking by and I, you know, I went to stop and I said, I wanted to stop and say hello, but like, you could see, he was like, I got 14,000 days left on the planet.

Can't talk. Got it. Yeah. Incredibly powerful. I I'm grateful. He took the time with you because I learned a ton from that. Uh, you know, it's funny with these podcasts. They're they're all good. We, I mean, you pick people for a reason, but there are some of them you go back and watch again and again, and I get very hurt and I've probably watched that 23 times.

I'll watch this 1 20, 30 times. Yeah. And again, this is the guy who said something about a time you were thinking about what that actually is. Trying to get it to soak in. He had already dropped two or three other more balls nuggets. Wait a minute. You know, he knows. I mean, everything that he says is going to be the most he's impeccable with his word as he possibly can, because that's what allows you to deliver the greatest message in the most efficient amount of time.

So it makes you like, yeah, absolutely. I can learn. How does this tie into an eco. Huh? Well, you know, like ecosystem, right? Everyone, like the Burdoch is always going to be dynamically, accumulating all the nutrients out of the soil that it possibly can. There's no wasted time in the cycle of a plant.

Dynamically assuming nutrients and that it's coming out, it's flowering. It's going back to seed. It gives you those nuggets. Like you guys are talking that has all the genetic technology that you need to carry an entire cultures, like food stuff in a gourd. Right? So, I mean, there's no waste in nature.

Everything either goes to make soil or it goes to regenerate perpetuated. So this guy's just a little seed and I challenge her again. I think Joe had said, boom, he goes system. And speaking of the ecosystem, he goes, I'm kidding. But, but he did say, but, but it's funny. I was actually thinking ecosystem and the idea when he said, I don't pretend that I'm the most important person or this most important project, this is great.

But somewhere along the way, someone will come along and do something better. This will. And I know that's going to happen and I just trust very hard mindset, but very awesome. Yeah. He attached to his own success. And so, so, you know, speaking of ecosystem, it's the idea of, and then I'll find something else and that we find the universe will continue to provide, which is again, but again, like so many people that we've been talking to this season are like these.

Networkers and connectors. Right? And so with our new ecosystem, that has so many startups. I mean, maybe there were always a lot of startups, but it seems like now within the business ecology, like every single person has a new, great idea to fill some niche that hasn't been fulfilled. And he like that is just facilitating people to be able to find those opportunities in that new, with that said, we are going to check out here, go to spartan.com/pod.
