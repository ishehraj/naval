Let's do Anna here for the tech scene for scene Stevie at launch conference 2013 with Navarro from angel list. Hello, how are you doing so excited to talk to him? He's a, he's a big guy. Okay. So let's. So let's talk about angel list. First of all, it's gone through a lot of stages. Did you, uh, did you always know what you were doing with it or did you just go roll with it?

Yeah. You kind of roll with it. I mean, we're the world's largest network of startups and investors, a lot of high quality tech startups and sophisticated investors. And we recently added the ability for people to recruit entrepreneurs and developers and designers on angel list. And we also now accept applications to incubator.

So if you're a startup, you can apply to many incubators for me. Uh, and we're constantly working on more things. It's actually, it's actually designed to sort of bypass recruiters, so directly connect small companies with talent. Uh, so we have 50,000 companies on angel list of whom the vast majority obviously were aspirational or never got funded or went out of business.

So their developers and designers are available to the companies that did raise money and are recruiting and are scaling up. And it is from what I heard. There's sort of like inside thing. If, if, if the people on the inside of angel list really love a company, they will get the word out on the inside. Is that true?

Uh, yes and no. I mean, it's, it's, uh, like any network. Yeah, there's a curation issue. You know, the startup industry is very large and now there's a large community, but only a few of the startups are really great are turned to huge companies. Um, and so the investors on Angeles as well as us are always sorting through and curating and features.

The best companies. Um, so it's not really a network like Twitter or Facebook, where you make friends and you chat with people. Uh, it's more of a place to show your real world accomplishments and the hopes of getting noticed by the top investors, in your opinion, is it best to start early on angel list or only go out at once?

You're really ready to start funding. Oh, you can go immediately. I mean, especially now that we take incubator applications, a lot of concept stage companies are an angel is they're obviously not there to raise money yet. Uh, but you can create your profile. Uh, record your accomplishments like LinkedIn, you can have your profile ready even while you're not job hunting on LinkedIn.

So you can have your Angeles profile, uh, in progress as you're building. And then when you're ready for fundraising, can you hit a button saying we're opening a new round, you can add your attraction, you can add your commitment, those kinds of things. Just one last question who inspires you? Uh, you know, it's cliche of a Steve jobs has a continues to inspire me, use his products every day and love them.

Obviously I'm not building something that great, but it's, uh, uh, I, I always look back at his Stanford commencement addresses to his, uh, pursuit in life of the things that he loves. angel.co check it out. Follow Nevada, Nevada. Thank you so much, navel.
