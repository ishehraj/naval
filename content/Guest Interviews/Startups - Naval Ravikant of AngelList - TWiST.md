![[y2mate.com -  Startups  Naval Ravikant of AngelList  TWiST 244.mp3]]


Today's episode of this weekend, startups is brought to you by Walker corporate law, a boutique corporate law firms specializing in the representation of entrepreneurs and by liquid web, a leader in managed web hosting since 1997. Hey everybody. It's Jason Calacanis it's this week and startups today on the program, the co-founder of the almighty amazing age.

The vault is with us. Stick around.

Hey everybody. Uh, what an amazing program we have for you today, Nevada  take it, right? Yes. You did count like a K you know, like Emmanuel Kant con yeah. Yeah. Uh, co-founder of angel list, correct? Three years ago, two and change. Right? Three years ago, nobody knew who you were. You were like this like angel investor who wrote for venture hacks.

My mom knew who I was. It wasn't totally, basically completely under the radar. You create angel list and now angel list is the most important company in Silicon valley. I read. Thank you. Uh, I read that too. I think on your newsletter, I read that, uh, in all seriousness, what an amazing two and a half years it's been, since you founded angel list, it has now become the premier destination for people looking to raise capital, hands down.

I mean, I know this as an angel investor, how many people. Uh, have raised money to date. I mean, I don't know if you put that number out, but just give us an idea of what the range is. Uh, somewhere between one and 2000 companies, we don't really know because we introduce them to investors and we don't track it all the way through, but over a thousand reported back in which means the real number is actually quite a bit higher.

A thousand plus companies have raised money through Angeles, correct. In two and a half years, which means every day on average, somebody has raised money and probably two that's right through the system. And three years ago we did not exist. And the ability to find these angels prior to angel list was what, how do people find an angel, uh, offline networks, conferences, friends of friends, VC firms, right?

So Angela's a little misnamed, uh, about a third of our members are actually venture capitalists or seed funds, right? So it's sort of the whole Silicon valley ecosystem community extended out to London, New York, and a few other major areas brought online. And it's people who are interested in funding, the angel round seed rounds, although we've probably gotten about 30 series eight has done as well.

Now that's a really fascinating development. Is that a new development? When did the first round get done on it? Uh, the first one that I know of was Talia back in 2010, but it actually happens fairly regularly. Uh, ear rounds are not our bread and butter because they're acquired companies that have a lot more traction and it takes a while to build a relationship with a VC before they'll write you a $5 million check, right.

That set is still does happen, um, fairly regularly, but that's not the main, uh, part of the site. Now, the rounds that are occurring today this year, as opposed to three years ago, when you and I met and I was doing open angel forum and you were doing angel investors. They're much different. Yes. How so the market has bifurcated.

So because of the increasing consumerization of everything, uh, what's happened is, uh, we have, uh, companies that go from being nothing to be in huge, overnight successes, or at least they look like they're overnight successes, like the Pinterest or the Ubers of the world, um, Twitter, Twitter, and so on. Yeah.

They come out of nowhere, will traction, uh, and G pop, right? And by the time, um, they have the traction it's obvious to everyone that they do. And these are winner take all businesses or markets. They end up being extremely valuable in short periods of time. So the investing market itself is starting to look just like that, which is if you're pre traction, you may be able to raise your seed round, but it's very hard to get an AA after that.

Um, however, if you have mega traction, you're fundable at almost any price and everyone will fight all over you. Um, and if you're somewhere in the middle, it's actually very different. So, you know, for the mathematically minded, the outcome is, uh, it's like a very steep curve of distributions. It's not, it's not linear.

And so the fundings themselves look the same way. Now, if the funding's, uh, for people with moderate success that you say, that's the hard part, moderate success. Well, no success is the hard one. Well, of course, success in no traction, but the promise of we're going to try to do something, you know, I mean, at least it's open country, but correct, but you get to make that promise once the first time you don't get too big at twice.

So if you raise money, the promise was we're going to get traction. You didn't get traction usually, unless you're a superstar team or there's some other true mitigating factor, you don't get to raise money again. You have to go restart a new company, really. And that's the advice it's so easy to start a company in terms of the assembly and the corporate structure, the people that, why would you get stuck with a legacy of a small field?

Right. Why try to hold on? And so that means we're going to see a lot more people just shutting stuff off. Yes. But these are efficient shutoffs. They cost a couple of hundred thousand dollars, not millions of dollars. They cost a year of time, not five years of time. So it's a great little way to send a space probe out.

Find out if this planet's inhabitable, right. It's not. There's no. Don't go back to that planet. That's one analogy. Another one that I use is it's like a music movie software, right? You, you try and create your, uh, you know, your hit band. And if it didn't work, if the sound wasn't quite right, you put another band together.

You don't, you know, toilet obscurity for decades. You could, but investors aren't going to fund that. But it's just a mistake because there is a misnomer of the overnight success. Absolutely true. So there, there are true overnight successes. Uh, w w which is an anomaly, which one? YouTube might've been a good example truly is a Sunday.

Right. They just immediately got the number of spot on Google search. Right. Um, but then there are misnomers, the Pinterest was not an overnight success. He toiled that a few years beforehand. A couple of years. Yeah. In different incarnations, different companies. Uh, Twitter was not an overnight success. It was flat for quite a while.

Yeah. Yeah. Uh, so I think it's, uh, OMG pop 35 games. Radio. Well, you pop, you have to divide up. It was a flatline company until they, until one game of theirs when ported to the iOS became an overnight success. Right. So, yeah. So it's not an overnight success in truth, right? As far as investing investors go.

Correct. So the misnomer is leading to people calling it quits too early, you think? Or is it because we're giving the, you you're giving the advice? Hey, maybe just unplug, right? Cause it's easier. And so it's easier to fund by unplugging, but is it easier to get to them? I think the startup industry is now such an incredibly complex and diverse ecosystem that all generalizations, like these are idiotic.

Yeah. They all kind of tend to fail. Yeah. It's highly contextual. Right? It's like, I could tell you that 10 great piece of advice for building a startup, but you'd have to apply them each in just the right way. Just the right time and know when to ignore half of them. Right. And so it is highly, highly contextual.

If it was this easy to pattern match, we would have all figured it out. Right. And it's a constantly changing ecosystem. It's not us, it's not static. It's quite dynamic. Parts of it have been arbitraged away. So if you have a company that has doubling in user base every month and you have millions of users, no, one's going to ask you anymore.

What's the revenue model. They're just going to write a check. So that arbitrage has been fixed, right? So there's certain obvious things have been picked up, but, uh, all the subtleties and the in-betweens and the gray areas, that's what it requires judgment and a trained eye. And so there are times when an investor will look at you and say, okay, you tried your best.

You tried that thing. It didn't work. Hmm. And that'll be the right answer. Other times, they'll say, shut it down and that'll be the right answer. And other times it'll, they'll say, keep it going. And that'll be the right answer. And it's highly contextual based on who you are, how big the space is, how well, you know, and how many ideas you've tried, how good your iterations are, et cetera, et cetera.

So there's yeah. With all of an OMG pop. I mean, just to take that as one example, I mean, how extraordinary is it to go on for five years? And they were going to pull the plug on the company, they were out of money and they were laid off half the people. When you see that happen, does it make you just absolutely thrill for entrepreneurs?

I mean, it's a great thing for entrepreneurs. It's also frustrating and painful as an investor, because then you just don't know. I don't know what's going to work till it works. Maybe it goes back to the adage of, you know, you bet on great people and then you cross your fingers and you hope. I mean, that is exactly what happened there.

I mean, they just kept trying, and it was also true of Rovio who made angry birds, took them years. Um, so something about it being a marathon. True. I definitely believe that as an entrepreneur, you'll never accomplish anything great in life, unless you stick with it through the end. Right. And so, uh, I was reminiscing the other day of the six or seven really amazing deals.

I've been fortunate to see in my career. Most of which either passed on or didn't get into, but right. No. Yeah. How about the six or seven deals? You were lucky to have a meeting, right? These are not the deals you did. There were some like, you know, People have passed on like a, you know, Dropbox and Twilio and people that didn't get into like Airbnb and square and so on.

And, and people I did like, like Twitter and Foursquare, and I was thinking to myself, what was a common thread amongst each of them, cause very hard to draw a common thread across such a large group. And I realized that, uh, the entrepreneurs were extremely deliberate in every early decision that they made.

They were not haphazard. And the reason is because they really felt like they were laying the foundation for a ten-year business. None of them was thinking of it as something that they will try and flip. Um, so that's not necessary, but not sufficient. There are plenty of entrepreneurs are forward looking who will not make it.

But I think that unless you're extremely, forward-looking in it for the long haul and you, and you lose that with every fiber of your being, um, you're never going to build a great business. You could pick up on it in hindsight. Jack side insight. In hindsight, there is something to somebody like Jack would is square, or, you know, drew from Dropbox.

Like we're going to solve this problem. Right? We've got a great name. We've got a great logo. Look, every detail out the name, the logo, every investor, every person they hire where they put the office, every little detail really matters to them because it is they're laying bricks to a foundation. And they're saying, am I going to be able to deal with this five or 10 years?

No. And so the sloppy entrepreneur, who's not really thinking about that stuff. It's a little bit of a towel that maybe they wouldn't even be there they'll sell when they get the first offer or they'll shut down when they hit the first row speed bump. Yeah. Um, the, the critique of angel list, which even saying there's a critique of what you're doing critiques.

No, but I mean, for people to critique the fact that you have had your partner have created a platform that, uh, you know, is funding a person a day. And at this point it's probably three or four people a day. The fact that anybody could critique it to me, they're missing the point. I mean, this didn't exist before, and you will that, uh, with your team and to being, so it deserves, you know, reverence as far as I'm concerned as an entrepreneur, because I wish, wish that what you, you or somebody like yourself had done what you did in 1994 and 95.

I mean, this is a world changing. Wouldn't have worked back then, I guess, but it would have worked certainly in the last 10 years, this is our fourth attempt at it, by the way, really, there are no overnights, so I know overnights. Right. Um, and what would you S what was the, what were the other type of venture hacks?

Just doing the BA on venture next in 2007, we actually launched a little social network called the power and deal flow network, which died in obscurity. Um, and then in oh eight, uh, we had a Google group and in oh nine we had a Yammer mailing list. And then 2010, we launched it just as a straight email list and it worked wow.

So four times only for only four. Um, so the critique. The weak companies are getting funded and you're creating too many startups. How do you respond? Uh, I don't think that's necessarily true. Uh, I mean, I think all these companies, many of these companies were fundable. Anyway, the way we do the best job is when they're companies that are out of market, not very connected, maybe in the wrong location, maybe not the networking entrepreneur and we surface them.

Um, nobody is twisting anyone's arm to fund these companies. Uh, you know, the investors meet the companies offline, do their due diligence and compare notes. Um, and in many ways for, for an investor, we are their wet dream in terms of due diligence, because they can see who else is looking at the deal. They can trade notes, they can see what the competitors are.

They get a full landscape, they can even see evaluation data across many companies. They can say this would have been done before. Yeah. Like venture sorts or something like a more transparent venture source. Right. I mean, the funny thing is I get both criticisms, right. Uh, which is some people say you're, you're adding too many dumb angels to the system, which is not true because we vet and screen them very heavily.

And then we get the other critique, which is adding too many dumb companies to the system. So what we're actually doing is we're at increasing supply and demand, it's kind of matching up on both sides. Right. Um, and it makes it more efficient. And by the way, efficient marketplaces are more. Right. So the more efficient that is the faster, it will adjust to information.

So Angeles adjusted information very quickly. And for an example of that would be okay. An example would be if you're the first one in the space. So I can, I could identify trends as to what kinds of companies were fundable at what points in time. So there was a point in time when a new social network was fundable.

Then there was a point in time where that new social networks suddenly needed a million users. Then a web based social network was no longer fundable. You needed to have a mobile social network. There was a time when a hot new mobile that was fundable pre-launch now mobile apps are no longer fundable pre-launch.

They need to show user growth. So you can see these tipping points and they happen very, very fast. There was a point in time where a daily deals, vertical company was actually fundable. Two weeks later, daily, these vertical companies were not fundable. Now it's a bad word. So marketed, just say daily deals.

It's like, oh, we already know that Groupon stock did X. We also know that their margins have these problems. You know, there's hundreds of competitors in this space. So, uh, so the information travels a lot faster. Hey everybody, it's Jason Calacanis and I am thrilled to announce that liquid web is a sponsor and a partner of this week in startups.

As you know, we only accept partners who really bring it, who have great products. And if you need dedicated hosting, if you need cloud services, these are the, these are the guys for you, really 24 hour, 365, a day, 365 days a year, heroic, heroic tech support, Tyler, her Relic, and you know what? That means.

Something goes down. You gotta call somebody at one or 2:00 AM in the morning and you need it to get done. You need a hero and liquid web is that hero for you guys. Go ahead and go to this weekend.com/liquid web and get a hundred dollars of free hosting. They are a natural disaster, neutral states like Michigan and Arizona.

Nothing bad happens in those places. No bombs are going off. There's no hurricanes, et cetera. And you know, you can only see how, how good a services by who uses it. Yes, the company, you keep speaks volumes. That's what my grandfather used to say to me. You should here, Jason, you are associated with the Sony corporation and they send you to California to represent them.

That's what you just said to me when I worked for Sony as an it guy. And that means a lot. That's a very big corporation out of Japan. This is what she would say to me, right? He was so amazed that I worked for a Japanese company. It was 80, 90 year old Irish guy. He couldn't imagine that a Japanese company was operating in United States.

Anyway, the point being, he was so proud that I was working at such a big brand. I had a Sony television. I bought them anyway. Look at the clients of liquid web. I mean, these are the best clients in the world. American cancer society, the New York times, Hitachi red bull, dun and Bradstreet. Oh, I'm sorry. Is that the United nations logo?

And it's good enough for the United nations and MTV and Porsche and Motorola and answer your I'm more impressed with Anthem. I remember. Oh, that's some good syrup and Bose, huh? Boxy. Start-up GM Symantec, Michigan state. I mean, this is just their feature clients. These guys have clients like you wouldn't believe what an amazing firm.

I highly recommend it. I guarantee you're going to have a great experience. Go to, I talk to the folks at liquid web for your web hosting needs. You want to have that power of like dedicated iron with the ease and use of cloud computing. You need to have big arms. Sometimes when you got these big projects, you want to have somebody who's a partner with amazing customer support.

That's liquid web, liquid web. Go get it. It's amazing. Good job. And both signal and noise. What happens when a lot of people follow a company and they don't close their round two, do they, is it a Scarlet letter? How does the entrepreneur take that? Cause I, that must be happening that people are signing up.

They don't do a great job or the idea's not fundable, whatever. Only 7,000 company profiles on AngelList at any given time only two or 3000 are actually actively fundraising. The rest of them are in various states having fundraise prepared to fundraise, building up or just hanging out. We've launched our talent service recently.

So they might be recruiting. They may be building out their profile for press visibility. So it's not obvious all the time, whether they're fundraising and have succeeded or not. Um, secondly, I think the whole idea of these very discrete rounds of starting to disappear, or at least it's getting smudged.

People are raising money and longer and longer interval, six months rolling as they go, uh, adding stuff in convertible notes have made variable pricing possible. Um, so. It used to be very hard to raise. Uh, fundraising was very discreet. Every 18 months you would go out, you would find a lead, you get a price equals around.

Um, and you would spend three or four months doing it now with convertible notes, the cap can move. So you can say, okay, it's a 5 million cap today. We raised our UK. Then two months later, it's going to be a five and a half million cap or 6 million cap because the company made progress and so on, which is brilliant later, angels can still get in, but the longer you wait, the more the cap increases.

Yes, the, the firefighter, it is the private market is extremely inefficient and the inefficiency creates weird behaviors. Um, so people knock angels for having a living like mentality where, because of social proof, these rounds end up oversubscribed. Um, but it's rational in their part because what happens is they see, okay, Jason invested in the company, um, Jason invested at a 5 million.

I've got that signal. I've got that data. Oh, wait. You know, here comes, uh, you know, Dave McClure, he's investing in the company or whoever else. So they're getting more and more signal and more and more data, but the price is not moving right. Of course is rational for them to want to come in. So until there is true pricing in this market, you're going to have irrational lemming, like behavior.

I love this idea. Then as an entrepreneur, I raised the first hundred from somebody who's got really true social capital, a Kevin Rose or something. Correct. Um, or a Dave McClure, uh, or a Dave Morin and yeah. And venture capital used to be the bundling advice control. And now people have come along like Y Combinator and Techstars and angel pad and so on who say, what are the advice?

And then people have come in like Yuri Milner and start and start funding who say, we're money. We just want to give you money. Um, and the control provision has gone away. So you're starting to see the whole system ecosystem becoming unbundled. So I think what's going to happen on the angel side is you're going to have a small number of very highly value added angels who will get compensated mostly for their advice and for being first movers and be the tastemakers, if you will.

And the money will come in after them at a higher price. So let me ask you as an angel, what is the best thing for a person like me to do? Should I be joining a venture capital firm? Should I be raising a fund? Should I be just an advisor and promoting it? What, what, what is the, what is this done to, to angel investing?

Cause I know my behavior has changed a little bit. There's so many people who want me involved in so many qualified products and projects, and I know what the qualified ones are through angel list or launch or other things. Right. But there's too many for me to invest in what, what is the future for a guy like me or for any of these other influential angels should talk about it.

It's rational now, which is rationalizing, which is, uh, people use to sell them their investment based on their value add. But now through the unbundling, you can sell your value at directly. So don't value your money, value your time. Got it. And so the companies that want you as an advisor, um, make sure that you don't take on too many of those, make sure you get compensated appropriately for the advice.

And there will always be someone around the corner who, who will be willing to provide money, as long as they're assured that this is a genuine commitment of your time and you're taking responsibility for the outcome of it. You can't just sign up to advise everything correct. Otherwise your brand goes out the window, right?

Right. And the, the advising is a district discrete section on the angel list profile. For that reason you believe in this? I do. And we're going to be adding more stuff around that, right? Oh, like actually, what did they do? Like how did they, oh, there's of course ratings and reviews and feedback. And we already do a little bit of that, but we're also going to let companies say explicitly, we're looking for advisors and for advisors to say, I'm interested in meeting you for giving advice.

Interesting. And with the review. I've gotten really good reviews of late, but in the beginning it was a little bit mixed. You used to be able to, if you've met with somebody connected and followed right away, not connected and followed, you have to have taken an introduction to that. Safety supposedly met them, but, uh, there's two problems with that.

One is sometimes people would click the button for the intro accidentally and not follow up and they get a negative review. Right? And now we delete those. We find that being the reason and the other is there is a huge distinction between someone you invested in reviewing you and someone you just met reviewing you.

And so we have to separate those two out and we will do so. Yeah. I think it's a key factor for us. I was looking at, I was like, oh my God, I got a negative really crushing. Yeah. The, the, the reviews are not really there to establish some kind of a magic stack ranking that this person's automatically better than that person.

It's there just to filter out people who might be scammers with somehow slip in the system or who are trying to sell their services on the side, or, you know, do something them. I have a little bit of that. Right? Those predatory people. I mean, one of the reasons I started the open angel forum. Which in a large way, at least in San Francisco been replaced by Angeles, um, in terms of what it's, what it's needed for, which is fine.

Um, a lot of those people were predatory. They said they were angels, but they were really, they were paid to pitch schemes or Southern services or selling services. We don't, we try not to let them on the site. And if we get negative reviews and then we throw them off, there are a lot of people call themselves brokers.

They broker an angel deal and they will get 5% of whatever money you raise. And 5% of the company, plus they want a $10,000 a month. Retainer is this normal, this behavior since Silicon valley, New York, um, Austin LA, and a few of them, Richard, um, scenes for angel investing. I think that's largely gone away, perhaps naive entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs outside of tech or newcomer investors may try those kinds of things.

Um, but among the sophisticated people it's been largely wiped out, but that did exist absolutely until. It's just been totally that disease has been killed. Yeah. One of the top part because of what you've done and some of the work with the angel forum and right. I think there's really two huge shifts that have happened in the last half decade that have very, very lopsided shifted the balance of power towards entrepreneurs.

Um, one of those has gotten 10 X cheaper to start a company. Sure. Um, and so anyone can start a company. You don't know who the next exact might be, so you have to treat everybody with respect. So it's a bit more of a peer relationship. And the second is you've got hubs now for distributing information across entrepreneurs, and it could be oaf or even the fund data.

It could be angel as it could be Y Combinator or Techstars or your incubator, or what have you. So these information clearing houses clear the reputation for the investors. And so I think it's no coincidence that the recently highly ascendant brands in venture capital like Andreessen Horowitz and true ventures are co are firms that have built a reputation for being entrepreneurial.

Right. So entrepreneurs are trading data much, much faster. They're figuring out what standard terms on what aren't, they're figuring out who the good investors are and are not. Um, and they need less money than ever. So they have more choices of who to raise from. We're not raising our rates at all.

Exactly. So it's creating a much, much nicer market for fundraising, for the entrepreneurs. What is the impact? A lot of VCs are scared by what you're doing. I've heard VCs say things that, how would I put it? Um, we'll paint you in a bad light. There was a little bit of what is he doing? He's screwing things up.

This is a terrible place to be. And some people publicly deleted their accounts. This is ridiculous to follow. It was only one actually. Okay. Bryce from, uh, uh, Riley tech ventures made a big public thing about it. I'm not like, I mean, we have to talk about it. He, he took the time to write a blog post about it as he's since come back to the site.

Uh, no, here. So he's holding out and he, his criticism was what, uh, his criticism was, uh, and it was valid in the early days when the Angeles was small, everybody knew each other. And then as it got bigger, you had people who you didn't know, investing in deals. And at the time we did not have a social graph.

So we would send you an email saying this is a company and so-and-so is investing. And he's saying, who are these people that are investing, right. You're telling you, trying to brag about people who I don't know who are investing. So you're just trying to use me or, you know, trick me. And so that was his criticism and it was about that at the time.

But now Angela is structured around a social graph. So you really see the activity of the people that you follow and their bio's are all there. So you can make up your own mind about whether the signal is meaningful or not any fraud in the system. Uh, no attempted fraud of the date. I mean, if you mean like Bernie Madoff start Friday night, um, yeah.

Or maybe somebody says I have five investors, let's say like fraud, I have five investors, but those people actually haven't yet. Uh, we actually do a two-stage confirmation. So when you add an investor to your profile, that investor gets an email to confirm or deny. And if they don't deny it, it says unconfirmed in giant banner.

Right. So you've really thought that through. Yeah. There's a lot of confirmation steps that go on on it don't happen in real life, by the way. No, they don't actually, you meet with an entrepreneur and they'll say, Mike Maples is investing. I'm able to be like, no, we just had a conversation, you know that's and then it's like, well, what happened?

Exactly. Who's lying there. Right. Did somebody give an indication that they would invest? And then that's the delicate dance, but yeah, certainly. And it creates a tracker. What about creating fake fo accounts and this kind of stuff? No, because hard on angel, right? Don't handle money. You still have to meet the person, do your diligence, do all the vetting it from the moment you meet someone in Angeles, the moment you do a deal, it would be weeks to months.

So there's an, there's a lot of process that goes on behind it. And if we ever get any indication that people are investing through a phone call or through an email. We, we dissuade them and trying to remove them from the site. We tell them, do not do that. And we don't want you around. Interesting. You say that, uh, jobs act, uh, at, at the time of this taping is passed, I guess Obama is going to sign it.

Yeah. So just pass the revisory should pass the house today. Right? Uh, president Obama is expected to sign in the next few days. What impact is that gonna have on entrepreneurship and starting companies? Angels? Yeah. Good, good positive one. Uh, jobs act is a, is a bundle of things. Sure. There's something in there that everybody likes and something that everybody hates.

And so it ends up being this, um, giant shouting match with people talking past each other. Right. Um, but if you're in favor of making it easier for companies to find capital, small business and entrepreneurship, I think generally there's a lot more to like, than to not like specifically the provisions around crowdfunding as one part of the jobs act.

The other part of the jobs act is easy onboarding and IPO. Uh, there's actually four, I think of it as four distinct large pieces. Um, one piece is crowdfunding. That's probably the most controversial, but also sort of the most, uh, inspirational. Yeah. Um, there's a piece a way, isn't it? Innocuous? I mean, people can only put in up to $10,000 or a thousand dollars.

I mean, you could bet your entire house with a bookie or invade. Yes. You can leverage yourself 10 X in real estate here. You can't do more than 10% of your income. That's an interesting point. So that's a hundred X swing. Yeah, no, no, no more because real estate is on your net worth. This is, this is just on your income pre-write so if I have a net worth of a million dollars, I can leverage, you can do that.

You could probably do that the four or $5 million house. Right. Whereas if you have a, if you have a net worth of a million dollar income of a hundred K a year, you can only bet 10 K a year. You can only bet 10 K into a company in crowdfunding. Right? I mean, it's, I mean, if somebody gets hurt, it is. I figured like the people who are going to lose money in Ponzi schemes have probably already lost it on commodities futures, currency in the stock market, the stock market.

Sure. We're real estate. We're just on the, our mortgages that they've got suckered into signing that went up to 20% and the stock market or currencies or futures is not injecting primary capital into a business. It's secondary trades with other participants in the casino on the other side. Right? So the chances of beating a commodities trader who does it every day for 12 hours, and you're just some Schmo, right?

It's pretty low. I think that the chances of actually investing in an app that you might use on your iPhone, that you can promote and give feedback on is probably a little bit greater. Yeah. At the same time, I think people who engage in crowdfunding will need to be educated about portfolio theory and, um, you know, how to diligence and vet and do the wisdom of crowds thing on a startup company as well.

So there's no question. Some people will lose money, but people lose money on prosper and lending club too. And some people will make money. Yeah. I prosper and lending club, of course, priding micro loans. Correct. And so you can provide, I mean, prior to this, I didn't even today, prior to this being enacted, you could fund the buying of some goats and Zimbabwe, right?

You could make 5% interest or 8% interest or whatever it is, but you can't fund an iPhone app on Kickstarter or Angeles or anywhere, and get a 1.1 equity. Right. And unless you happen to cross the magic accredited threshold of million dollars in net worth, in which case your judgment is suddenly goes from being useless to foolproof.

Well, obviously that parallels reality is obviously when you put a second comment into anything, your IQ just triples. I mean, it's insane. And then Democrats I saw were fighting this and afraid that people were getting were going to get scammed. Do you think that they're fighting it for, and then somebody told me Republicans were fighting it because they felt they would take money away from the bank.

So those are both gross simplifications. So explain what you mean. It passed the Republican house unanimously, the Republican vote and the Democrat side is everyone except a small fraction. Right? So, uh, and the small fraction, I think, was mostly concerned about consumer protection. They were concerned that, you know, someone's going to call up your grandma and trick her into buying stock in some iPhone app.

And she wouldn't know any better and she lose her retirement, um, which are somewhat valid, but the other hand, existing laws already exist to protect that and just should be enforced. Um, and if anything, the crowdfunding restrictions are quite severe. I mean, as an investor, you're going to need to take a training course.

There'll be a 21 day waiting period. Before you can invest that masters will need to take a training course, correct. A training course. To be an investor. Yes. So when you go to Vegas, you can sit at a black. Yeah, exactly. So you can go to Vegas, you can put a million dollar, you put a hundred thousand dollars to house the car, the kids education on black.

Right. And have no idea how it will work or what your odds are, arithmetic nothing, but to invest 10% of your yearly income and 1% of whatever it wants to being your net worth, let's say you need to take a course. Correct. Wow. And you'll have a 21 day waiting period. So I decide I'm going to do it. I take the course in 21 days, then I can make my first investment.

Correct. So I can't do it off an infomercial. Right. And then there's huge liability for the company. If they omitted any information, you can Sue their directors and the officers in the company. So even doing this is not even raising money through this may not be advisable. I think it depends a lot on what the SSC rulemaking comes out as, because there's going to be a six to nine month period in which the sec will make the regulations around it.

It could end up viable. It could end up non-viable right. Just based on the STCs, whatever investor protection they put in. Correct. They'll have had to be through clearing houses. There's gonna be some yes. Licensed intermediaries who are trackable watchable, you know, et cetera. Angel is going to be one of those.

Is it something you would consider or why would you even dip down into this madness? I don't think it's madness. Think of it structured, right. It can be a great way to let companies raise capital, get more companies funded. Um, and it can also be great because it allows normal everyday people to have a stake in the outcome, come with a Protestant vision on a democratic basis.

You like it? I do feel like a lot more, well, I'm not sure we'll do for Angeles, right. That's what to say. Cause it wouldn't it. Yeah, you'd be, if you do it. Would you not risk driving away, accredited investors who take it seriously? The Bryce comment of who is this person, right. I think we'd have to separate it out very cleanly.

Um, so I think there's, uh, two issues for us. One is, um, does a rulemaking allow us to do it in such a way that we feel we can prevent fraud, keep the quality standard high and keep the community alive and active and engaged that's number one. Um, and number two, is, is it going to be set up in such a way that the kinds of companies we deal with are going to want to use it?

And a lot of that depends on the details. So I just don't have an answer for you and it will be something like a million dollars you could raise up to a year. Uh, I believe it's per 18 month period, but don't quote me on. Yeah, I thought it was a year, 18 months. They might've changed it again. This is all being channeled, a lot of amendments three or four times.

And there was this amendment that amendment Walter, the visitor, um, if you could raise a million dollars every year, you could essentially fine. Uh, Facebook like company for the first number of years, you could, you could, and companies are so cheap to build. Now. There's no reason you couldn't fund it all the way you could fund it all the way to IPO, potentially off of consumers, a hundred K a month.

You know, even for a barrier company, it could be like six, seven engineers and one or two business guys and none. Yeah. 10 person company, and the public keeps funding it. They love the product, but something like Reddit, you could fund an angel list through crowdfunding. You could fund an angel list with the Crawford.

That is, I'd think you just ripped a hole in the space, time continuum by doing that. It's too meta. It's doing better. What if I did a Kickstarter product? I do a Kickstarter project to do a, uh, an art project to do a competitor that would raise money on angel lists something, something, yeah. Space-time continuum issues.

Yeah, it definitely sort of starts to break down. So, um, Is there a bubble now or not in the angel space? I mean, I basically have to ask this question to you. So I got to say this in a non Angelus context, my personal opinion, I think, you know, it's frothy. Um, and I think it got frothy because the valuations got out of control.

Uh, not because there's anything wrong with the premise. I think it's fine to, you know, fund lots of small cheap companies that, you know, the majority of which will fail and the occasional one will come out and be a tremendous home run. But it means that you have to have a fairly broad portfolio and it means you really got to pay attention to valuations.

And I think along the way, uh, the table turned valuations were probably too low in oh 5 0 6 0 7. And as a VC or an angel, you were probably getting an unfairly, good deal. $2 million valuations. Right. And then I think it got on the other side where the entrepreneurs figured out, um, how to create party rounds, milliliter, everybody signs on, they control the price and they got away with very large, large prices, which means that even if the company is a success, the portfolio math might not work for the investor, but I think the investors are going to figure this out.

And I think it's already adjusting. So I think prices are rationalizing they're rationalizing now. So it got a little bubbly, like just poured your sparkling water into a glass, but then it comes back down and it's NASDAQ goes up and that was, that goes down. Hey, everybody is Jason Calacanis of this week in startups.

I'm here with Scott Walker, who is the CEO and founder. Walker corporate law group. Welcome back to the program. Great to be here, Jason. Uh, let's take another one of these critical issues. Uh, when you're starting a company, intellectual property, IP law, this includes everything from trademarks to patents to copyright lots of different words, but typically it goes down something like this.

And I get approached by these as an angel investor. I have an idea that I've been working on on the weekends while I'm working at IBM, Google, Microsoft, and I want you to invest in it. And now I'm like, whoa, whoa, wait a second. You're doing this on company time where you're using the company laptop who owns this, right?

P is the IP clean? Uh, what do founders need to know in this type of situation? How do they get themselves? Um, Angel ready fundable when they are, the IP was maybe created on the weekend. Yeah, no, that's a great question. There are certain mistakes that are deadly and IP is certainly one of them. We talked about vesting previously IP ownership, and the sad thing is Jason, as you know, it comes up when the investors come in and do their diligence and it's like, whoa, what is going on here?

You were working over at, uh, IBM, like you said, and doing this. So the answer is you got to sit down with a good lawyer and a sorta like a checklist of IP ownership issues that we need to walk through and address. And it may very well be okay. You know, if you're not, for example, in California, not using their facilities, if it truly moonlighting and you doing it on the weekend and it's not in their space, then you may be okay.

But I mean, there was some tricky issues and now we've got to make sure that, that, and it's like little tests that add up to the other party, having a case or not. Right. And this is what I think confuses a lot of young entrepreneurs is that it's not black and white. Right. There's interpretation. It. Right.

Exactly. And sometimes you have a good relationship with your employee. You might be able to get a waiver, you know, it's like, Hey, here's what is a waiver? A waiver is basically, the employer is saying to you, you know, Jason, the entrepreneur, you know, it's murky. We may have ownership rights to your IP, but we're going to waive those rights.

We're going to let you go ahead and do your venture. We love you. Maybe we'll take a little equity, maybe give us one, whatever it is, but we're not going to cause any problems. You can bring that wave into your investor and say, everything's cool. And I've had this happen multiple times here at Mahalo.

I've had people say, I'm working on this project on the weekend. Would you sign a waiver for me? And then I say, Hmm, well, I like this employee or not. This is why it's important to be good to your boss. I usually think, you know, and people sometimes ask, can I work on this? And they, they do it ahead of time.

They can do a waiver ahead of time. So they don't get an anti-Trump I'm thinking of working on this project. Will you sign a waiver, right? And, or I've been working on a project where you sign a waiver and most bosses will be reasonable if they're not, you really should work for that kind of book. Anyway, you need to get out of there.

Um, These are great issues. And of course your firm is a boutique firm, which means you don't charge huge fees. You've got that $2,500 while you can eat all the questions and emails, a startup package. Well it's 2,900. Yeah. So in all filing fees includes you pay about 900 bucks filing fees. You form a corporation, Delaware, you qualify where you locate, usually California.

And there's a whole bunch of documents that we take care of for 2,900 bucks. Just you lose money on that. Well, I guess it's a way of, you know, who gave me the idea of Nivi at, uh, angel, uh, lest he said, lose money on the formation, but make it back and build a relationship. Yeah. Don't make a free cause then you get a lot of, kind of, you know, bull screwballs.

Yeah. They got to have a little bit of skin in the game. Right. So, so they actually are committed. Right. It's kinda a little test and um, yeah, it's really a great way of building relationship. It's obviously there are a lot of questions. First time entrepreneurs have, they're afraid to pick up the phone and call the lawyer.

Cause the guy's always billing. Once they call us, we want to help you. And you're, and you're investing in them for the longterm because if they become, Hey, they get to be around their C round, it can become a meaningful client for you guys. Yeah. And that's what we want are, what we're trying to do is help entrepreneurs.

There are a lot of unfortunately bad guys out there, you know, at your level and level of, you know, the Brad fells and the mark Susan. So you guys are amazing. Right? Right. Trust. It's not an issue. You probably don't even need a lawyer. But when you get down in the second and third tier, unfortunately there's some bad guys out there.

Yeah, all kinds of weird operators who want to take, take your 5% of your, whatever you want to. You want you to hire them to raise money for you. And that's like 5% warrants, 10%. That just totally destroy these like weird characters. And you didn't have a lawyer to protect you before you sign anything.

Exactly. Anything you're going to sign. You got to show to your lawyer first. Hey, Scott's a great Walker. If you're a startup company, I highly recommend you hire him. Uh, and you can reach him@swalkeratwalkercorporatelaw.com. That's walker@walkercorporatelaw.com. You should just get Scott. All right. I'm wearing the tie over here and you're nice and casual.

Just get Scott at worker corporate. Alright, well, let's get on with the show and that's that that's that goes down, but in general, you know, creates value and wealth. How, um, how much does the stock market impact angel investors? So, uh, backing up for a second. Most of the investing in the seed community is not driven by true angels.

It's driven by VCs and seed funds. Um, and most of those are reactive on Angeles. We've actually gotten deals done with entries and Greylock Kleiner. Um, you know, a lot of the top firms first round, you know, et cetera, et cetera, deal gets done. A person posts onto angel list. One of those partners sees it, it takes a meeting and then it originated from angel was correct.

And so in Jason harvest and those kinds of people, they just think, oh, angel, this is just another great source. Yeah. Especially with a little extra fat, right. Especially for the top tier VCs. They love it because they know they can get into anything. So more visibility and more deals being created as good for them.

Um, I think really the VCs who are, who may not be as happy about it are the ones who had a proprietary access to some very narrow deal flow. Like they were sitting as a bottleneck in some university or some location where nobody else was around the proprietary access to deal flow is going away.

Everyone knows everything. Now information is free. Right, right. So all, and this is one of the last strangle holds really of like, this is the one of the last opaque boxes, private company funding at the early stages. Right. And then it'll take 10 years to unravel fully, but it will. Right. And some people are kicking and screaming, but generally speaking, the great companies will rise and the great investors will rise.

Right. And the mediocre ones will take a big hit. And so that's right. And so as an investor, you have to compete on your judgment and on your, um, uh, and basically on your brand, your evaluation. Right. But you don't get to compete on your proprietary access, right. Or the fact that you just happened to be a VC with a checkbook, right.

That. It's not enough anymore. Right. There's too much capital in this world I'm looking for return. Right. And is this creating, or are you creating more angel investors, do you think? I don't think so because, um, we've actively resisted that. So some of our criteria for getting listed as an angel, an angel list is you have to have done at least two pure cash investments in the past.

Um, and uh, you have to have be someone, a reputation that community that we can check out. And of course you have to be accredited. So really what we're trying to proxy underneath is have you lost money before and been okay with it? Um, so we only want people who are not going to get bent out of shape when the entrepreneur loses them money.

So in that sense, we're really not trying to create new investors. This space is highly regulated and there's a lot of litigation in it. So we don't want to get sued when that person loses their money. Right. Um, so, uh, you know, we don't really view ourselves as a vetting or training ground for new investors.

How do new angel investors then get trained? I mean, angel, this doesn't exist for that purpose. It exists. For a different purpose. What is the mechanism for that? Because I see a lot of angel angels and training people who want to be angel investors coming to the events I host and then getting on angel list or asking me for a referral to angel list kind of thing.

Only for those people. The best thing is to invest with someone, you know, alongside into one or two deals, get your feet wet, invest in people that, you know, learn a little bit, go to an incubator demo day, see the lay of the land, make your mistakes there. Yeah, exactly. Um, which is exactly what's happened. I had two or three people who wanted to be angel investors and they said, I want to invest in something at launch.

Can I invest in something? I said, well, you have to make that decision yourself. Yeah. We've rejected 75 or 80% of the angel applicants to Angeles. Wow. Wow. Seven, eight out of 10. Yeah. That's a significant number. Yeah. We could easily be at 12, 13,000 investors we want to. Right. But you just don't want the agita of having to.

Plus the startups care, the startups, like who is this person? Right? The better the startup, the more they care about who gets to see their profile. Who's in the round, back to your original point about signaling. And if you care who your investor, you probably have something worth caring about. Right? Right.

Fascinating point. Yeah. Um, and, um, the impact of things like Facebook going public in a couple of months, weeks, whatever, a single VC from entering or leaving the seed market will make just as much of a difference as a Facebook IPO, just because VC firms have so much more capital that they put to work regularly.

So people look at the Facebook IP and say, oh, we'll create a thousand angel investors. But, uh, 10 investors coming in who invest a hundred times as much as any of those investors is the same impact. Right? So you have to work out the math and it's the venture business. I mean, it's a troubled business.

Obviously the returns are just not there. A lot of people can't raise funds. A lot of the people who raised a billion dollar funds. Seem to be cutting it back to some sweet spot of 300 million or 400 million, because I couldn't put the billion to work. At least not with good returns. Is the venture business consolidating?

Is it, is it going to get much smaller? It seems like everybody says, there's this a drought, the series, a drought. It's not a drought. There's a series, a bottleneck and exists in this short period of time because a lot of these seed companies got funded and they assume that the natural thing to do next is to go raise an a and I would argue that it's not the right answer for very small percentage of the county.

Who really are exploding with traction. The right thing is to reason a for the bunch that haven't gone anywhere, and the founder does not have the tenure stomach or the vision to, you know, do it in their basement for awhile. The right answer is shut down and restart something else. And for the ones that are sort of in the middle that are growing, but not quite breakout, the right answer is to go get more angel money and it may be at a low price, but it keeps the dream going.

And there's this assumption that like, oh, I raised half a million bucks in the next round. I must raise 3 million bucks. And I had this evaluation that I must have a higher evaluation and I had five people not right. And that's incorrect. A lot of businesses these days can be built very, very cheap cheaply.

So I raised 500,000 on angel list and I come at a whatever, $8 million valuation or something or 5 million. Come back a year later or 18 months later with some progress, raise another 500. Yeah. At a slightly higher violation or the same or the same. Yeah. I think that's totally reasonable. And you're going to see a lot of that.

I bet. Yes. We're already seeing a lot of that. We call them seed primes, internally seed primes. Yeah. What does that mean? There was a seed deal, seed prime, like in math, a prime. So you kind of just say it's the new, the next iteration of interest. Okay. And is that a Scarlet letter? Is that a, oh my, this is a bad sign.

You to do a good sign progress and have some traction. You can't come back and say we're still pre-launch or, you know, it failed completely. We're pivoting. Um, if you're pivoting, it's up to your existing investors to fund you. If you're pivoting it's up to the associates. Yes. They have to believe in you enough.

Correct. That you've learned enough to do that. Yeah. Interesting. So, uh, Is there you think the Kickstarter and Indiegogo and some of these places will become competitors to what you're doing when the crowdfunding law comes out, what's your take? You think Kickstarter is going to start doing equity. My guess is Kickstarter will not play, uh, because they are the market leader.

They're doing really well with the artistic and creative community that they have. And, uh, going into a highly regulated space where you're investing in, uh, companies that, uh, are not actually going to deliver a physical product at the end. So there's no compensation other than the company might succeed is very, very different.

I don't know if they'll go there, but my guess is probably not. Um, I think he sees that on this program. He's definitely not going to, but that was a year ago. And that was when this was all speculative. Yes. And I think indie Gogo and some of the others might just because Kickstarter is leader. So they got to go left when Kickstarter goes.

Right. So the differentiator, correct. But I think this is going to be very different thing. It's not the same at all. There's no business. There is there though in taking 5% of a hundred thousand dollars round or something like that, what is that? Uh, well, I think the crowd crowdfunding intermediaries are going to take a transaction fee, so that percent, 5% roughly.

Yeah. And then what is the paperwork going to be like from a lawyer? Probably a nightmare. This is going to be a nightmare. Yeah. I mean, you have to automate that and put it all on mind. Someone's gonna to blaze the trail and figure it out. Somebody's going to have to make some check these boxes, whatever.

And so is there, it seems to me like a bad business, or it could be like a business that doesn't really make a lot of money. I'm sure you could have said that about Angeles and still could. Well, I mean, I guess that'd would be the followup question is what is angel list in the business of aside from disrupting everything and helping entrepreneurs, which I know gives you great pleasure and is entertaining for you.

And, um, you're an entrepreneur's entrepreneur and an angel investors, angel investor. I mean, anybody, who's an entrepreneur, an angel, who's known you as could say that about you. Um, but what is the, what are you building here at LinkedIn? With social component, is it, is it a Kickstarter? And it's hard to say we sort of follow you don't care right now.

Don't really care. I mean, I think we can look back in hindsight and connect the dots. That sounds really intelligent, but, uh, you know, looking forward, I think of it a little bit more like Craigslist, which is kind of an open community for all the needs that our startup might have. Um, all the information based needs should frankly be free.

No one should be charging for those things. Right. Um, and, uh, we can take a few of them where, uh, we can bring in additional value of the system, not tax the participants, but bringing in some additional value, get paid for it. Um, and that is still today. Yeah, it seems to me like if you're a lawyer, accountant headhunter, you should pay.

Large fee to be on that cyst straight. So we don't yet let lawyers, accountants, head hunters do any sort of, I think that they're trying to sneak in there. You think they're using their like angel investors accounts or, but the, the messaging permissions on angel list are really locked down. Um, people trying to message people run into lots of gates and barriers.

We calculate social graphs and connections and credibility and all that. Yeah. Um, and you can't just use it as a promotional tool? No. And if somebody did, right. So did somebody make that list? They were doing a once in a while. Someone sneak, somebody created a list, like we're making a, so it was almost like they were making an angel list and they use angel list to make another angel list that tells you right there.

Um, so I, you know, people can get away with something once and then that's about it. Yeah. Um, so we have a lot of tools for filtering and stopping people in the background. But I think, you know, uh, we just very softly are testing out our talent marketplace. So if you go to angel.co/talent, you can see there's about 400 companies there who already have their beautiful startup profiles and all that info.

And they just add a job posting. Right. I just did it. And you know, what's interesting is somebody saw it there and that's how we wound up getting our new sales person for launching this weekend. I mean, he was already in our orbit. Right. But I did use that and did a tweak to that page. I was like, oh, free listing.

I don't have to go. It was faster. And it's associated with our profile and we have, I think launch profiles of 1400 people on it. Yep. Does that make sense? Top five, certainly. Yeah. Yeah. And then we also, uh, we've added about 300 candidates to the system. We just start softly, starting it out. I saw that.

Yeah. Yeah. You had emails. Um, you had emailed, I guess some folks to say right here is a couple of candidates we think are particularly no worries. Right. But there's not about 300 of them sitting on the system and you can go and you can go through developers and designers, and it's a little harder to not style system.

So you can say you're interested or you're not. And go to the next one. And then the people who are interested in each other are just introduced and matched up again, creating massive value for all parties involved, taking nothing. Correct. We've done 900 of these introductions in our first few weeks. Wow.

Yeah, that alone could be. And designers who are all former entrepreneurs, if just, if it was a membership of whatever fee, $500 a year to just have access to that one. That could be recruiting recruiters, charge 25 grand, a pop for the placement. Right. You could actually just charge based on if, if a deal actually occurs, it's $5,000 and you just pay an honor system.

Yeah. And you, if you find out that they didn't follow it, although I think we'll keep it free for a long time. I think free is a good idea. Yeah. Um, and we want to make sure it's really working well and provides a lot more. Yeah. That is the new, that's the thing that's changed. Now we see some conflicting advice about that.

People say, don't worry about making money. Just get to scale. Let's make something people love. Right. And then you get the other half of the angels in the same panel or the same coffee session. We'll say, what's your revenue model. Where's the revenue. You got to start with revenue, start with revenue who is right.

Right. So is the problem with generalizations, right? I would divide it to two cases. One, if you're playing in a space where it looks like you can eventually make money, then just grow as fast. If you're playing in a space where it's not at all obvious how you would ever make money, even once you're huge, then you better have a revenue model.

Um, so see if people would actually pay for the service or if there is a revenue model, test that early lean startup style. Yeah. You can do that. So, I mean, I think since we're in the middle of transaction flow, um, I'm not worried about it longterm. Uh, but I think like, for example, if, uh, something like Twitter, um, could not make money until it hit media scale, it was a giant business, which it did.

So now I can, but the kinds of criticisms you're talking about would normally have been leveled against a company that would need to hit media scale to make money. We don't need to hit media scale to make buddy, no, you need a hundred recruiters or HR. People should top 100 companies right now in the talent system.

We don't let recruiters on. It's only CEOs and founders. I think it's much better. Yeah. And if, if you force CEOs to take ownership of recruiting and not. It's going to be a much better result because you have better candidates, right. We're sending them great candidates and we want them to get top attention.

We also asked the companies to list how much equity and salary they're offering, and the companies had disclosed the equity and salary in the offer get to go upfront. So smart transparency for the win. Yeah, absolutely. And, uh, wow. That's just mind blowing. So we actually internally plotted the salary and equity, different companies offer on a graph.

It's crazy because there's so many prenatal, optimal situations out there. This, uh, the whole system, the private market system that we operate in Silicon valley is so opaque that it creates all kinds of inefficiencies. Yeah. And so you can just take that transparency, arbitrage gaps for people to explore it, and then it'll close the inefficiency.

Got it. What, what, um, is your advice for somebody placing, you know, a good, a good idea on angel list? What's the best practice today? What do you see? Works completely. Don't leave. Don't leave like a half empty profile. Um, I see people who just leave entire sections important sections blank, and think they're gonna get a meeting just because they're their name.

Um, it's very important to have a good bio, you know, show why your team is impressive. Uh, describe your product, have a one-click link to a demo, to a good working demo. Lots of screenshots. If you have traction put up a graph and make it numerical, don't try and snow or game investors, they see a lot more deals than you do.

So they're much better at unwinding BS than you are in suspending it. Oh wow. That's a good one. Yeah. And then if you have people who are supporting, you're committed to you, add them to your profile so people can see who else is interested in, you involved with you. Interesting. Uh, and the don'ts, uh, don't add investors as advisors.

It's a negative signal if there's such a good, if there is, if you're so exciting, why aren't they investing? Um, Right. I'm only going to advise if I'm an investor, right. Don't uh, don't be too secretive or stealthy. It's okay to hide how you do something, but don't even try and hide what you do. Um, yeah, I've seen some of those.

There was one famous entrepreneur who was on a couple of months ago and don't have Hakim the trended in one of the week with going after the trillion dollar opportunity in X. A few can do that if they're really branded entrepreneurs, but your average yeah. I took the meeting. You really have to make sure you're not saying stuff like I'm a visionary or I'm the CEO.

We know you're the CEO. You started the company, tell us something we don't know. Right. So try and emphasize what you've done. That's interesting or impressive in the past, other than starting this company, uh, you've run this company at a really amazing clip in terms of the product cycle and the development.

I mean, it's raw, it's run as fast or as efficiently as a Facebook. You know, as Zynga in terms of the analysis of data and also how big is the team. Uh, the team is now about a dozen people, but most of what you see was built by four or five people, it is amazing at the progress we're making on a technical side.

Yeah. We ship, I think we ship more code than anybody. It's pretty amazing. It's like the best startup is the one that's helping with the storms. Why not raise like a huge fund? I mean, clearly you now have this huge power base is the idea of there being an angel list fund. I mean, Techstars, right. Dave Cohen started a fund.

You had a little angel fund prior, right? Right. Yeah. We played with the idea. Um, and uh, occasionally I invest in some of the companies, um, all of his, on an optional, voluntary disclosed basis. But, um, you know, that just seems like the old model it does, doesn't it? Yeah. Something about it doesn't seem right.

What about taking 1% of every transaction or getting upside and everything work, the good startups with leaving the good ones. Matter that account for all the values. Right. So the second you do that, it signals adverse selection, adverse selection. You have two keys off the adverse selection process, and now you've got a bunch of weak products, right?

Weak. I feel that a lot of the reason why there's been very little innovation in this space is that it's too easy to make money. It is too easy to get a cut. It's too easy to raise a fund. And so people always go for the easy money. Yeah. I can keep getting pitched on that for launch. Like, why doesn't it launch on the font?

What does it launch? Take 5% onstage. And I said the same thing. Well, the second I take money that I'm just like everybody else. And then I lose the great companies, right? Like, I dunno, space monkey, all tuition, whoever you want to be on stage of. Yeah, that's right. And the great companies are what matters.

That's what makes us whole business. Yeah. So what's your goal in life now? I mean, you've made enough money. You don't have to work and think at your last company. She did. Okay. I did. Okay. You did. Okay. So reasonably speaking, I'm not applying on jets, but I'm Silicon valley. Middle-class middle class, which means you're rich.

I was going to do, but you're not flying on private jets. Correct. You can feel very poor when your friends invite you on their jets. Um, like I do. Um, although I'm investing in a company that kind of, uh, is going to do the jet thing, the thousand dollar a month, collaborative consumption, excess seats on the jets, excess seats on the jets.

Yeah. We'll see if that works. Maybe I'll sneak on to one or to sneak onto one or two. Um, what's driving you now. What do you want to do? I mean, you got the gray water now you can retire usually. Yeah. Uh, well, you know, I mean, this is running, you've got a serious company on your hands. We worked day and night, 24 7, and you got 12 people and this is can only go in one direction.

Violence can only go to a 50 person company, a hundred person company. I want to keep it small. I don't think that's possible. Now it's too impactful that the world needs it too much. It's going to be an, every. It's going to have every we'll outsource a lot. Maybe you can be our offline Nicole. Exactly.

Yeah. Just to go to a lunch event, that's sort of what I tell them. We have this sort of collaboration already, but I mean, you can't keep the small, the world needs it. And that's like saying, you're going to try to keep Kickstarter or, or Facebook, smaller Twitter, small. It's not your choice. I think you can get a lot of leverage through code and community, but you can't keep it small.

Every startup and every investor in the world will be on there at this pace. And people I've been pitched on five different angel list killers. It's too late. You, this is going to go to, you cannot be an angel investor and not be on the list. Uh, we'll find a way to scale if we have to add people, we will.

But I think large companies don't innovate as large groups. Don't get it. Okay. So you're, you're scared of that. That's your big fear is we'd stop innovating. Is that the biggest fear? Well, two problems. One is large companies. Don't innovate too. They're not fun to work at, right. So you've got to try to figure out how to keep this company.

I'm a lousy manager. You got to keep it under 30 people. I'm trying to keep it at 15. Yeah. Even if that's even, that's a stretch, it becomes less fun. Doesn't it? As an entrepreneur, less fun, too much coordination costs hard to move. Um, I think that's where we'll try and do a few good select partnerships or just hand things over to the community.

I think it's smart. It's almost like a Wikipedia style. Like we don't have to be involved in every single thing. We don't have to extract every ounce of value. Yeah. And in fact, every ounce we extract, we give away. So one of the problems created large companies that force you to find a large business model, which means you got to tax the environment more, which means your quality goes down the leaner and smaller.

We have to think about that. The leaner and smaller, we are the less money we have to make. The less irrational stuff we do that might hurt the community. Wow. It's a completely different way of thinking about the business. Don't try to make money. Um, don't become a slave to the burn, so you don't compromise the integrity of the product.

And that's a very delicate balance. And certainly if you're 10 people, there's no chance of that happening. You can easily just monetize. It's almost like Reddit, you know, like Reddit has been able to keep their digs community suffered because they needed motorization so badly to please the VCs and rent it's didn't.

It is the curse of venture capital, the curse of venture capital. It's the curse of capitalism in a way. Was this a new tech? What is this? A new type of capital? No, I mean, I'm still a capitalist at heart, but, uh, I really do want to be a billionaire. I wouldn't turn it down. I mean your heart up. I mean, it's, that's a nice way of saying it, but extra money will not change my life.

Um, so it's more important for me that angel is be impactful. Be a part of the ecosystem, makes it simpler, more efficient, more transparent for you and Novalis. It's about being the change change and having the best product that provides the most value. That's what you addicted to. I'm the suicide bomber.

You are in a way. I mean, people, I, that was the term I was looking for before. Thank you. When people were really nervous about you, like, I remember a year ago, the VCs people calling me, what about Navon? Uh, uh, you know, like all this, and now they've all just like dominoes falling and now they all realize, like, I guess in a way in the beginning they were S they were trying to dismiss you, but now they can't.

Are they all coming, circling back around to kiss ass? I mean, I think we have a lot of VC allies, actually. I'd say we have a lot more than you might think. Oh, you do. But there was, there were a contingent of people who were like, this is pretty threatened. Yeah. There were a small number, but luckily they coming around.

Yeah. I mean, I think they realized that first we don't take a cut. We don't discriminate. It's an open system. So we try and run it as an invisible platform. I'll leave you. He think that you're going to try to insert yourself into the deal flow and take their deals. So they should be, they should feel safe in the knowledge that you, in order, the reason you have so much power is because you don't use it.

Well, we don't use it the power, right? No, we don't. We don't do any partnerships for that reason because we don't want to be viewed as if you decided at some point to be on angel list, you have to give us a point. You would get it for some period of time. And or if you had to give us a, we'd also be shut down as a broker dealer.

So there is that slightly less easy issue, right? Just a broker dealer, not good, not good. And what is the sec think of your business? Do they look at it and go, oh my, because I mean, second market doing fine. They've got a clean bill of health, but that other one shares post. And I was getting emails from sheriffs post on a pretty regular basis.

And I signed up for it because obviously I have to check cause they put all my companies in it and things I was invested in, but boy did it feel pretty salesy when I was getting pitched and I'm an accredited investor, but right. It was like once in a lifetime chance to own part of Twitter or I don't exactly how they phrase it.

What's the sales pitch, right? Well, we don't, well, unlike those guys, we don't take a cut. We don't handle money. And, uh, you know, it's a kind of an open social network service I can list. So we run much more like a social network than like a broker dealer. So there's no issue, there's been no issue, but we, we will explicitly, I'll go on record of saying we will never take a cut from either side.

Wow. Never, ever, no, I guess in a way, if you throw the great party, you will, because of it was a drink for me, cause you're always going to, somebody will always buy your drink. That's fine. I think that's a great philosophy in life. And you know, I have to tell you, like, when people said the same thing to me about the launch conference over the five-year, it's like, you should demand that you can get into every deal.

And I said, why would I demand something that I don't have to ask for it? They all want me to invest. And they don't because they see the effort I've put into trying to make it successful for them. They you'd never get out of blocked out of a deal. And the consumer, uh, investing business brand and reputation is everything.

And the way you build a brand reputation these days by serving the entrepreneurial community, it's almost a race to see who can be the most helpful. It's just the way it should be, which is the way it should admission around. Cause I mean, the value is all in the entrepreneur and the effort they put in 12 hours a day, six, seven days a week, pukey in the shower from the anxiety of, okay.

When VCs say that they build companies, they support the entrepreneurs, but they don't build the com. Yeah. You know, you, you have an edge about the VCs. You've had bad experiences in your career. I think all of us have who have been around long enough. Yeah. They were particularly poorly behaved a decade ago.

Yeah. I can't talk about that. You can't talk about it, but they were, you, what's the worst story, not about you that you heard ever about a VC. I'll tell you mine. Uh, the worst. I haven't really thought about ranked that way, but what's the one that comes to your mind. Yeah. There's plenty where you see good founders getting replaced by sort of bozo CEOs.

That's probably like the number one that I have entrepreneurs commiserate about. I really feel that as an investor, if you can't back the founder until the founder's ready to give it up, then you probably shouldn't be backing that founder. But that's a personal opinion. I kind of like that. Yeah. And if the founder feels they still have to keep going in a way it's there, right?

Yeah. If you feel that the best businesses are built by the people who stick it out, who persevere, then you only want to back the people who really will persevere. And then when you back them, you sort of make the moral compact with them. I'm going to back you correct through good times and bad. Also the smart entrepreneurs now are no longer giving the VCs the power to fire them.

That power is going away. And that was an innovation by Sean Parker coming out here with mark Zuckerberg and. His company, the way he wished Plaxo and other companies haven't sent it yet. I think that how much better you get shown? I gave him some, I think a lot of people did it about that time. I mean, adventure hacks are, our tagline was, um, uh, evaluation is temporary controllers forever.

And it was all about basically don't fixate so much on the other pieces. Just make sure you keep control. And if you have control, then it's your company and the day you lose control, you're no longer an entrepreneur, you're an employee. Um, yeah. And sure. I'm Parker put it to work, I guess, most famously, most famously and very effectively and very effectively to this day.

And now you see Pincus reverse, I guess. I don't know if he reverse engineered it or whatever, but by the time that company went public, he had pretty tight control over it. There are many ways to do it, but they all lead to the same road. I like it to the Stanford prison experiment. You know, if you explain, that's a Phillip Zimbardo's famous experiment where he takes a students and he makes, tells them for a week and half of them are going to be prisoners.

And the other half were going to be, um, uh, guards. And of course the guards ended up abusing and pushing around the prisoners. And if you flip it around and make the former prisoners guards, the former guards, prisoners, the abuse happens the other way. And the lesson is that power corrupts. And if someone doesn't have power over you, they won't use it and there'll be totally nice and easily get along with.

And if they do have power, then you're going to have issues. And I think most of the VCs who have really good reputations have built them by being good stewards. And so in the advice controlled money scheme brand really, really mattered because used to give up control in exchange for money. So you want to make sure that people would treat you well.

And that's what brand used to mean that the difference with smart money and dumb money, it wasn't brilliant versus stupid. It was will treat me well or not treat me well. Right? Because you have the smartest guy in the world, but. They're controlling and they make bad decisions and right. They treat you poorly.

Yeah. And smart is not a substitute. It, I don't care how brilliant the person is. If they can tell you in one day, a month fundamental innovations or how to run your business and you can't that you need them to execute on. You're not ready in an entrepreneur. Yeah, that's correct too. That's correct. So where is all this heading?

What do you think of the space? I mean, you see how you've been in this for 20 years? Yeah, I think it's actually great. I think so, you know, I have this weird little fantasy vision that someday long after you and I are dead and gone, um, everyone will be working for themselves. We will all be businesses of one.

And we will plug in via API APIs into the businesses that we need to work at that day or the projects we need to work on that day. And the payments, the billing, the reputation, the new jobs, the sales, all of that will be handled through electronic means and free flow of information in a true free flow information system.

Where there's no transactional coordination costs. Um, your trust in your reputation will follow you and be able to find new jobs, take them on, do them, drop them, whether it's an eBay task, rabbit, Ola, and, uh, you know, you Lance oDesk or whatever, which is kind of a, not as nice version that we today all the way up to, if you think about what VCs do, you know, they're essentially freelancing around working with all these different companies, providing a little bit of value to each advisors do.

So I just hope we're heading more and more towards a company of one kind of day, right. And people can behave that way today if they choose to that's right. But a fluid system where you just open up your terminal or whatever it is, show up at some location, provide some value. And I think that the credits are in your system.

And I think that's how it evolved. You know, hunter gatherers worked largely for themselves and they ended up when they needed to and they dissociated when they needed to. And it, the curse of industrialization is that you need a factory and factory needs capital, and a capital means as an investor and then 5,000 people have to work together.

And now you're cognitive machine. And I think those cogs are being undone while becoming machines of our own. It's fascinating. It's almost like that free. And we had a freelance nation cover of wired. If you remember back in the day, like where, like everyone will be a freelancer at some point it'll happen.

And it's, it seems like it's a, or be completely opt in. If you want it to be part of some team innovation technology will make it possible. I don't think anybody wants to work for anyone. I think at the end, everybody would like to be the boss, except unless you are the boss. And then you're like, God, it would be great to just show up somewhere everybody and do work, but then a bad day, seven, you're ready to kill yourself again.

Very, very few exceptions. Every boss has a boss of, of, and there's always a bigger fish. Nevada, what an amazing discussion. Thank you. As I tell everybody, if you want to get the good stuff, just to finish the last 10 minutes, because the last 10 minutes led to another episode of this free. I mean, it's a science fiction story.

After we're dead, we just wake up in the morning and you find your job, your task for the day menu of tasks. Should you choose to accept it or not? Right. And if you choose to accept it to the walls, to your house, get a little bit bigger and does it move, does it move up in the skyscrapers for a better view?

And then if you don't work for five days, you go down five floors and it goes from 1200 square feet to a thousand until you eventually get to live in a 200 square foot place. Well, I think by then we'll all be living in little cubicles, but it'd be something like the fifth element. Yeah. The dystopian part of that.

Right. Uh, Duvall. Thanks for coming on the program. Thanks for having me. We'll see you.
