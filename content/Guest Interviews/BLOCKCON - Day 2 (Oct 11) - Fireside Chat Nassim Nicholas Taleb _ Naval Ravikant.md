![[y2mate.com - BLOCKCON  Day 2 Oct 11  Fireside Chat Nassim Nicholas Taleb  Naval Ravikant.mp3]]


hi, my name is Kashi and next step is Naval Ravikant.

Hi, I'm kismet. And next up business seam Nicholas Taleb. So this is the German version of skin in the game. But given that I don't read German, I don't know what it means, but they've used the word, the English word skin in the game. So let me talk about the concept, but it's not as straightforward as you think.

So I'm going to start with counter-intuitive aspect of skin in the game before even defining it. Okay. It's about how you acquire knowledge, how you, how, how you do things. So my origin, my nationals origin is trader. Okay. A lot of people have a national origin as mathematician or scientist or something like that.

And then they become traders. I started as a trader means. I stood with these people at some point and, you know, they spit on you. And so we acquire all the germs, particularly that they have children go to schools. So quite practically, and in a couple of years, it can practically cover every possible airborne disease that, that, that the planet can have and staying with these people on a bit and, and not always crazy, but when it's crazy, it's even crazier than it seems here.

So, you know, when you spend your time as a trader, I was working with mathematical products. I was also fading from the desk as well, which is less, uh, romantic as this, uh, kind of. A wild jungle atmosphere. So when you do mathematical training, you quickly realize that theoreticians are full of baloney to be polite.

Okay. There's something wrong about theory and their view of the world clashes, you know, was that if every trader we do things like people ride a bicycle or say a prostitute being lectured by nuns or, or, and, and you know about, about, uh, you know, about, uh, how to, you know, uh, how to do their businesses kind of thing.

Academics for us were people outside the practical world. Who've never done anything and their models. It's not that they're imprecise. It's a different world. So that's how the idea of skin in the game came to me because eventually you retired from trading, you lose hair. I had hair when I started, I lost my hair.

Uh, you, uh, you want to do something else with your life 21 years of trading, you know, you sort of miss it, but you, you want to grow up and become a real person. So what do you do? A couple looking for professions, but I wasn't good at anything else. Okay. And then I tried the retirement activities. Tennis.

Do you play tennis? No. Okay. I kind of concentrate. You're not playing tennis. So you lose concentration. And typically when you play, when you have partners has get angry. Okay. Complete tennis, complete chess. For same reason, you have an idea of start meditating when you're playing chess and you forget you're playing chess.

So I realized I wasn't good at anything. So I said, okay, I'm going to give a little academia. So I tried, I started an academic career working on modeling and telling academics or the full of baloney. All right. I'm being polite to the baloney replace was usually things that are clipped and on radio. Okay.

So, so this is the I, this is my bio. So in other words, instead of going from theory to practice, I went from practice to Siri. I saw something completely different. So let me explain something. I developed something called the ludic fallacy. The ludic fallacy is that the randomness and idea was probabilities.

The randomness that you encounter or in real life, absolutely nothing to do has nothing to do with the randomness you find in textbooks or in games. And I use the word ludic because ludic means games and Latin. Now. Sure enough, someone has a painting right. For sale at such. You know, such or I think exhibited at the Saatchi museum called the ludic fallacy.

And I can't make head of tales of what it means. Right. But it's nice to have your concept. Someone paint, painting, something has to be constant. He's probably on drugs and painted something and then read the Nordic fallacy and decide to name it, to name what he painted the ludic fallacy, whatever it is.

But I'm just showing it to you in case you can figure out because I couldn't figure out. So now comes the expert problem still. I haven't defined skin in the game. Have you noticed I may leave it to you, but so see, my bio started practice to theory, realize that things in practice are much more complicated than theory.

And that, of course, in theory, there's no difference between theory and practice and practice there is. And then the concept of ludic fallacy, because my specialty was randomness and. And I'll give it a name as we can see in the paintings. So with this, I'm going to explain the expert problem. There's two kinds of professions and the black Swan, I define there's a profession in which the professionals are really professionals.

They don't know what the hell is going on yet. Nobody knows that they don't know, or at least those who pay them don't know that they don't know what's going on as a professionals where people know what's going on. And how can we make the difference between these two and a black Swan? I said, okay, in domains, like what I call black Swan fraud.

Like the climate studies, they have no clue, but weather forecaster over the next week has a lot of glue. Otherwise it can't survive. So came up with this idea of expert problem, but I can illustrate it best with a story of a friend of mine who was also a. And had the brilliant idea to go lose his money in the restaurant business.

And when you retire, he, you know, he, and it was very nice because he lost his money. He prevented me from losing mine and that business. Now, what did he learn in the restaurant business, something quite central that can illustrate what's going on with our society. All the other society summarized in one as well, fallacy the, in the restaurant business, they have awards granted by newspapers and by and by of course, other restaurateurs, the best, uh, wood panel restaurant in the Eastern United States, the best sushi sushi in Western Canada.

And then you have these, all these awards. So my friend noticed that there was a gala dinner at every. There's gala dinner, every, uh, you know, say every year and, and during that dinner, the award, you know, the awards are given. So guess what? Most restaurants that got the awards were out of business by the time they had the gala dinner.

So what's the lesson there. Very simple lesson. Whenever you're judged by peers, you don't want to impress your peers. And that's one thing I learned as a trader, as a trader. There's a rule. And I remember when I was very, very young, a trader, I had a lot of hair and the badge said, no, new trader new member is called.

There's a, a, uh, an old fellow, you know, odd board, bald, typically all traders, grouchy and bored. All right. He come, Hey, come in kiddo. Yeah, he said, stand up here. Okay. He said, if people like you over here, You gotta be doing something wrong, so, okay. Okay, keto. Now we can go now. Right? So, so that lesson I learned from when you're judged by reality, it's a complete different dynamics than when you're judged by your peers.

So businesses where you judged by peers are businesses like the restaurant business will rot, okay. And businesses where you're judged by reality, but your P and L by your accountant, the only person you want to impress at the end of the day is your accountant. Now truly don't want to be hated by your peers, but it's not, they're not the ones whose approval you need to seek.

Now, academia, it's a business where people are entirely judged by peers entirely. This is what causes all the problems. We have. Bureaucrats who judges, bureaucrats, other bureaus. The bus, this, this, this, it doesn't work. There's stops to have meetings. You see. And when a firm becomes very large, you cannot associate the PNL attributed directly to a certain person.

They start having meetings, busy flight to Omaha, come back like, you know, do things, you know, talk to you on a phone for two hours as write long emails, stuff like that. That's the problem. And the tech industry too. There's a lot of tracking of inputs instead of tracking outputs. Exactly great engineer. It can create a billion dollars worth of value.

Look as a Toshi Nakamoto and a bad engineer can cost you value. It has nothing to do with the amount of time they put in yet. They're still managers who want the engineers in at 8:00 AM. They want them working 40, 50 hour weeks. And it's just complete nonsense. Exactly, exactly, exactly. And training.

Basically, you're just charged by the P and L if you lose money, no matter how nice you are, uh, it's not going to work. And if you make money, no matter how nasty you are, doesn't make a difference. So here plumbers, a plumbing. Has gotta be judged, not by other plumbers. You don't like, you know, the compensation isn't determined, like selective government calls up other plumbers.

How much should we give them in bonus? Right. It doesn't work that way. Okay. It's Josh by you. Same with the dentist. If you show up to the net, this office with your teeth intact and the dentist office, the missing visibly, there's a problem. Okay. You can cash them competence very quickly. So there's a judgment either by metrics as in mathematics or physics or in hard science or engineering or by some, or because they have laws or by some, the clients by reality, just like restaurants.

So, but you have businesses where people are judged entirely by other people. So this is why you can figure out if journalism is going to die, because journalists try to impress other journalists. That's their business. They're not, you know, they're not trying they're working on the reader so that you can have monoculture, it become.

So this is to explain the, the, that, uh, that what I call the expert problem is that they don't get it. The new Yorker doesn't get it because they are part of the expert problem. There's that 1% of people that you're going to call the IOI intellectual yet idiots, and that class of people, they have no accountability to reality.

There's just a count one another. And of course they're going to have is going to degrade as a business. And this is where, what do experts do when they want, when, when you catch them with their pants down, basically macro economists have never forecast anything. The guy like Paul Krugman, I hope I'm recorded.

Please make sure I'm recording Paul Krugman. He, he knows it's like worse than random. Okay. Why do we keep, why don't we replace them with Ms. Bree? She's an astrologist in the lower east side and it was a much better track record. Why don't you remember Ms. Bree equivalent to discredit someone like a. Or criticizing Crip.

I don't want to comment on, on my friends. Okay. Let me comment. On, on, uh, on, on, uh, this is the crypto conference and with a crypto crowd, right? It's, it's become popular to say like, Bitcoin is rat poison, or it's a, uh, it's a Ponzi and so on. And every time one of these experts has called it out as being a failure, it goes up 10 X.

I see. Okay. Yeah. I don't mean if these guys had a P and L, there we go. If Paul Krugman had a PNL, he'd be bused long before Bitcoin. Exactly. Okay. He'll have been bust with the election because when you have a PNL, you can't really bullshit your way through life. And the funny thing is, is there's no point in bullshitting financial assets because you can just go short.

It just puts your money where your mouth is. When people get into arguments about online, whether Bitcoin is going to hit a certain price by a certain date, you don't have to argue online. You can go to ledger X, or you can go to your favorite exchange and shorted, or just take a. Exactly. So Mike, yeah. I have an aphorism that, uh, you don't want to win an argument you're supposed to win.

It's very different. Yeah. So, and here, of course, what do the experts do? They compare themselves to pilots and we know that a pilot is an expert because the pilot has skin in the game, bad pilots, where are the bad pilots under water on the water? Because they have skin in the game. Okay. It's even what start, just like to like restaurant that can fall they're there, they're gone.

So there is a selection mechanisms that does not depend on judgment of other pilots, at least, you know, not, you know, uh, in the later phases of life. So, so that's a problem. So you end up having fields like economics. This is the mind of pick an economist. This is how they think, you know, they have that clarity of mind.

This is a good day or after a cup of coffee to express it. That's how they think. And it's just to tell you how their mind works. Okay. And they don't realize. Phase one. I made the mistake of getting an economics degree alongside my computer science degree. And I can tell you that in 20 years of venture investing in startups, macro has been completely worthless.

Uh, if anything, it's been distraction entertainment, uh, arguing about things that don't matter. It's just another branch of politics. Yeah. Th th th th they're not judged even micros. They're not judged by any, uh, contact with reality basically is they don't have a P and L if you don't have a PNL, you pretty much can because they can get what I call a circular citation ring.

They can get into any kind of game grant on another Nobel's and nobody would know the difference. So now I'm going to define skin in the game with a notion of symmetry. Okay. So before I was introducing Scott in the game from the back door, my, you know, my own experience with it, this is in the louver in Paris.

And this is the home Robbie's, uh, code. It's the earliest code we have found so far, 3,800 years ago. This was in a public place in Babylon. Most people can read. So those people would read it for you. You don't take a reader, come over and tell me what it says. And it says the following. If the architect builds a house and the house collapses, the architect shall be put to death.

Okay. Now of course it's quite harsh. It was Hummer. I remember. It's not like, you know, it's not, uh, we're not talking about Jimmy Carter or someone that was my Shirley or, okay. So how was, how were Arby's law? What, what does, how Robby's law? Amen. It prevents you from hiding risk. You can not hide risk and then walk away from it.

The architect will always know. About where the risk is located. And then you said they can hide it in a basement and somewhere it can hide it in a foundation where they can cut corners and then walk away and go to another city and let the building collapse and say, oh, it's no longer my problem. You bought it.

Okay. You can't, you can not walk away from the risk of hidden. That's the core of Hamas Arby's and let me show how I encountered it in my life. As a trader was something I call the Bob wouldn't trade that people still don't understand. It says follows Robert Rubin collected $120 million in compensation at Citibank for over a decade.

And of course, stuffing Citibank. He was, he was a vice chairman and Citibank was in taking some classes of hidden risks, like industrial. And sure enough, there was absolutely no edge to these trades. They're just blow up infrequently. And in 2008 Citibank was insolvent and who paid for Citibank who stopped it out?

Taxpayers. We did taxpayers. Maybe not you because I'm a taxpayer, you're a taxpayer. I'm sure you, you, you, you know how to, uh, defer taxes, the loopholes they're out. They will let me know. So therefore, okay, so you haven't been included in that class of people, your, uh, your dentist, your, uh, the bus driver, the Uber driver, they pay taxes, you know, that's because everything online and it's electronic, you know, the worst part is after these kinds of collapses, they say never again.

So then they put in place tax them policies that actually suppress entrepreneurship, or actually the people that actually create the upside black swans, it put more regulation and then they call us some very unfortunate, highly unexpected events. Often called black Swan for which we apologize profusely, but we are excused as nobody can predict these things.

We all gathered here as a co as a direct consequence of the Bob Rubin trade because the Bob Rubin's of the world lost enormous amounts of money. It was a generational theft of trillions of dollars, both through printing money and through taxes and hidden risk. We all paid for it, but in 2009 and unknown character named Satoshi Nakamoto released Bitcoin and in the Genesis block of Bitcoin, he cited bank bailouts as the reason why, why you can't trust the fed?

Well, why he created Bitcoin? I think he was inspired, right. Or at least dedication to Bitcoin in the Genesis block is revenge for the Bob Rubin trail. That's even more impressive, but that's that story? And of course, needless to say that this has happened many times in history in 93, there was something called the resolution trust corporation meant $600 billion at a time to bail out a category, go savings and loans.

They all got rich. One of them went to jail, was single person went to jail. The rest of the all got rich and retired. And of course, nobody showed up with a checkbook like Bob Rubin didn't show up on that day. It was a checkbook. He was just resigned and see it's a black Swan, 1982 banks lost more money than, than they ever made in the history of money center by banking.

So banks virtually have never made any, any money. They've just been living off of the taxpayer, but yet bankers are very rich. They just know how to socialize losses. Exactly. They know how to hide the losses. So that's the skin in the game. Thou shall not have the upside without bearing the downside of yourself.

You need to own your own risk. So that's the whole idea. After Hammurabi, of course we have had a little more, uh, let's say more, uh, what should I call them more? Uh, human, uh, softer rules. Okay. Like don't do to others. No more of this killing architects or something became the notion of symmetry. Uh, society became based on notion of symmetry.

Okay. You don't want to punish someone too much. You don't want to punish the little, you don't want to have, you know, someone victimize others with impunity. So there's a bunch of rules of which the better known one is a golden rule. Do unto others as you want them to do to you. And I, of course, and skin in the game, don't like the golden rule because the golden rule as a positive role.

And if I, if I, you know, I can force you to eat Lebanese could be all right, because that's what I like to do. So, and it also can invite busy bodies, governmental. Yeah, who make her do things because they like it so much more, much more robust to the civil rules don't do to others. What you don't want them to do to you or the negative golden rule, vastly more robust, all the people who are talking about censorship mechanisms of social media.

I think the intellectually honest ways you build a censorship mechanism, then you hand it over to your enemy to run it. And if you're not willing to do that, then you're what you're basically just saying is I want to be in charge, but you're trying to do it in a, in a intellectually dishonest way. You're trying to do it a face saving way where people will give it to you, but it's just the naked exercise of power again.

I see. So, and then, but the, the, the Greeks and the ancients were aware of it, basically that the captain of the ship needs to be. You've got a flask, not like the, you don't sneak out first, like the captain of the Titanic. And then you had rules on the wishes that you eat your own. Uh, mercury was walking by one day and a bunch of fishermen had, uh, a lot of, uh, I think that the tortoises, right?

So tortoises, sorry. Yeah. Bushes, tortoises and Libya or somewhere. And, and, uh, they were, they didn't like him, so I invited them to eat the tortoises. So mercury looked at them. I said, do you think I'm an idiot? Like with a New Jersey accent, mercury, he said, okay, you guys are going to eat all these tortoises right first, and then I'll eat the rest.

So he forced them to eat their own cooking for that has been present in pretty much in commercial law forever as a guiding principle, ethical principle. And you even see the entire sections of the Talmud are based on the cemetery. In other words, in transactions where there's consideration. And the contract and agro sets on contract based on consideration.

That's what comes from whether someone is taking too much risk for others. Like for example, in Rodion law, that's comes from finishing law. For example, if a boat saying for boat is pirates, say, take the merchandise or something who loses the money, how do you share it? Okay. All parties who can benefit from the transaction are obligated to pay the cost.

So you have to have complete equity there, and there are other concepts, like how much information should you disclose to the buyer? C how much should we disclose to the buyer? When you have a transaction, there is an ethical, they are a series of ethical rules. Yes. If the buyer is someone from your community, you are obligated to the two.

Vault everything. But if he's a stranger, how much do you use unfold? There are a lot of ethical rules that have, I mean, from that you can see in a Talmud, you can see it in Islamic law, and you can see that, of course, in Roman ethics. There's also a phenomenon when you have like long caravans of people crossing the desert or going through a difficult situation, like the exit is from Pakistan to India.

During that separation, if you were in the last few carts, you are most likely to get picked off by brigans and robbers. And if you'd lost something there, then the rest of the caravan was supposed to make it up to you. They were supposed to repay you because you were taking the most dangerous position in the back.

Yeah. So this risk sharing is actually, this was a part of, uh, Islamic caravans as well, because in it desert, it's the same story as robbers will attack those who are isolated in the backpack, they won't kill you over there to take your merchandise. And the other people are forced to compensate them or take turns on who's going to be in the back.

Right. So, so. Uh, this is not new, but there are a lot of nuances. And as we'll see in the conversation on basically modern life has lost some of these considerations and we'll see how at no point in time in history, I'm saying no point in time was few exceptions. One exception was India and other was, um, I think, uh, like Egypt at some point and the ancient Egypt, and one of them was one of them de France, uh, I mean modern day, like a hundred years ago, France, except for these situations at no time in history.

Did you have leaders who took less physical risk than the common person at no time? The whole idea of being a lawyer. Is you got to protect your, your, your trading status for obligation to protect. So another we've got to take more risk and a fault than wars, or sorry, this called the Malvina in some countries, you know, the Falkland wars, the, uh, the, they had to find someone from Royal family to fly, to take the most dangerous mission and helicopter simply to confirm that rule.

So, and of course, uh, we lost that. So you have, you can have some schmuck in Washington, uh, warmonger. Okay. You can have warmongers whenever take risks. So these animals now lead from the rear. Exactly. And we're warming up their civilian warmongers, whereas in the past, warmongers had to be the in battle.

And, and, and what does this, uh, cemetery do is that you want to cause people to die. You gotta be exposed. It, it brings some kind of national balance to society. And let me explain how if you get on three-way okay. You can easily kill 30 or 40 people. Okay. Already have to do is go in reverse. Okay. If you have a Tesla or car that accelerates very well, even better.

All right. How come you don't see these freak accidents anymore?

Obviously can a game the game because the driver bad drivers are dead. Just like bad pilots. Okay. There is. So that is a regulator. So it's same thing was wars. Hannibal was first and battle Napoleon first and battle. Napoleon was actually the complaint. He was way too overexposed and battle. Okay. On his horse going around the battle field.

Okay. And Napoleon, uh, Roman emperors. This is valerian a Robin who was captured by the Persians. Why? Because he was, had to be on the front line. He wanted to be. He's an emperor. You gotta be, you know, you gotta have a little bit of dignity. Come on, Julian. My hero truly in the past, it, the Roman emperor died with a spare lunch in his chest.

Why he didn't have a shield. So, you know, you had to take more risks because that's your business. Yeah. This guy, he ended up being used as a footstool Binarian reasons footstool by the, by the person emperor that's risk, less risk holding crypto thing, risk. This is a risk only one third of Amper died in their bed and we're not even sure they thought of natural causes.

Okay. So we never had that situation. So there's a way you got to, but people aren't fools, you can, you can tell that a person, a warmonger in Washington working for a think tank wants you to destroy. Syria likes the way we destroyed Iraq and Libya and the name of democracy. So he destroyed it because for them, democracy is very important, so they can not learn from experiences.

You can never learn from experiences. So these people, but we know they're full of crap. We know Thomas Friedman, they're just a hack full of crap. Okay. It's just unfortunate that that people listened to them in Washington, but the general population, the tech side, because the general population can detect if a person has cars or not takes more risks or not.

This is what's called a signal signaling in the sense that when you're a risk taker, you take, you have scars now and you produce these scars as an ornament. The Javiat signaling is a concept that we discovered. Why do Pete peacocks have these fancy tail? These tails, in fact, are handicap show their genetic superiority that they can function.

In spite of having these large burden entails that bring predators because they're good and strong, and they use this. I took in dry for India, this picture of the right in front of me, of the peacock. So there's a core set of Zahavi and signaling. Now it was called costly signaling. It's not cheap signaling, it's costly signaling.

You see a lot of virtues. We're going to talk about virtues that are fake because anybody could sit in all these virtues, but risk-taking is real. You cannot fake risk-taking you cannot fake, right. You can fake virtual, not real, or what we call regularly virtual. So this explained to me fundamentally, why.

We spent so much time haggling. I mean, over in theology, over the nature of the Christ, I come for that part of the world where this discussion has taken place, the Greek Orthodox church. If you had, if you had to, if you had the library, you'd have probably you'd fill in a stadium with documents about the discussions and the arguments of whether the Christ was God or was not God, but something like a God, what's the big difference.

And why did they always revert to the notion that the Christ could not be full God? Why? Because think about it. If you're a God, you don't have skin in the game, it's like an, a Superman thing. Right? You have to have some vulnerability somewhere, right? So you suffer because you have skin in the game.

That's the whole concept and Christology people didn't think of that effectively. They think about it. If you go to a circus and see an Acrobat was a parachute, or instead of an acrobatic with the pressure of the show, you and movie, right, an Acrobat you want, you want the person in front of you to take risks.

That's what you want. That's what you've paid for. Okay. You want real risk because otherwise you're not signaling any virtual, unless you've taken these user risks. And this is the story of the Christ. And this is something that people don't get. Is that any virtue that doesn't entail, some kind of sacrifice or cost is not virtual.

The gods in the old days, did not let you, uh, you know, uh, just, you know, uh, claim to be their subject. Let's say your loves is also something without paying the price. Without, um, without having something to lose for it. And now in our society, we have fake virtual was fake virtual. This isn't a hotel room.

They said, you say the planet, your guests say the planet. What am I doing here? Saving the planet or saving their a bottom line. Okay. So they're using the planet as an excuse. All right. Let's call it. I call it virtual signaling virtual that no cost you anything doesn't entail any risk-taking. There's no risk in what they're doing and you can not have virtual that way.

So, uh, so here, when young kids ask me, what should I be doing? Okay. In life, start a business. Don't, don't try to get a salary. Don't join it. Join an NGO because all they do is virtual. Similarly, maybe the, initially the, the founders really. But then you end up with people trying to game the system. People. I called rent a rent seekers, like the UN office in Lebanon.

For example, they talk about deforestation so they can have the staff and they can have the funds so they can fly first class and get a nice apartment. But when we look at the numbers, there's not the forestation you see? So you have all these, all this industry of NGOs. So the first thing is tell a young person do not join an NGO.

If you want to do well, start a business and fail, right? Because basically we need people. We can't live off a Peter's every salary you need to fail to take risks, just like a fallen soldier. Okay. Remains more honorable than someone who has never been a soldier. You see, is there such a thing as a dishonorable fallen soldier?

No, that soldier is very honorable. Why that entrepreneurial fail and why should the failed entrepreneur. Not something very honorable, more honorable than someone who'd never been an entrepreneur come back later shield or on it. Sorry, come back. Exactly. Come back with a shield or on it. So, so this is the recommendation you make is that start a business.

And then one thing I noticed, some people won't like this, but I, then I didn't think that Trump had any chance till I saw him standing with the 11 in the primary was 11 or 12 Republican opponents. And at a time, the, there was a campaign to explain to us that Trump was an incompetent businessman because he lost a billion dollars of his own money.

The American public is no fool. There's something real about losing a billion dollars if it's only your own money. So although it makes it a professor at university would think, oh, it's horrible to lose a billion dollars, like failing an exam life. Losing a billion dollars miss Uriel, and that helped them get elected.

At least help them in that stage of the election in the primary. So inequality, a lot of people talk what inequality. First of all, there's an error in the way we measure inequality, we measure static inequality, static inequality, the U S we don't do very well compared to say Italy or France, but dynamic inequality.

You realize that if you take 1982, the 1982 Forbes, 500 richest people compare him to the 2012. You realized that only 10% of the families cross the list. Okay. Whereas in Italy, if you do Florence 16, 20 and Florence, 2015, You will notice that the same names would be on the list, right? You won't find an outsider on the list.

So you got to look at it dynamically, basically in America, I think 60% of the, and spent 10 years, sorry, one year and 10% and something like more than 12% of Americans spend at least one year and then 1%. So you have the dynamics versus static. That's not the same. There's something fundamental about inequality.

People are willing to accept inequality. If the person who is richer is taking risks, they see your no accept inequality. If it's a rank seeking CEO, making 50 times or a worker makes, and people got upset about it, but people are never upset about Steve jobs being richer than, than, than others. And actually the Swiss were trying to pass a law is Swiss, could see the difference, the public who said it was trying to.

I mean, it didn't pass, but it was off close, but it was like 30, 40% of the people wanted to limit the salary of CEOs, but not entrepreneurs. There's a difference between entrepreneur because entrepreneurs have skin in the game to limit because society doesn't like rich people who made their wealth without skin in the game, you can detect it.

That's what's unpopular political agenda will conflate equality of opportunity with the quality of outcome. Equality of outcome is communism. It's a terrible thing. Exactly. Yes, coercion, but equality of opportunity is what you strive for it. Not that you can ever really have it. We all get dealt a different DNA hand and where we're born and how we grow up and what we learned and what our temperaments are.

But you can, you can kind of at least narrow it down through education, but you can measure it. You can also measure this inequality, the equality of opportunity with a negative metric. Most people look at the opportunity of people to ride. Well, if you rise someone else going to come down now, right? So you got to take someone else's spot.

So it's not quite a zero sum game, but still you don't want dinosaurs to stick around. So the best metric is how many large corporations fail today in the United States, the companies average life and the S and P 500 is 11 years today. And dropping used to be 60 there's price to earnings ratio is much higher than that, but that's because extremist standard extremists are a few huge outlier.

Exactly. So there's nothing wrong provided Google has, is exposed to going bust. One day, they say the same with the Arthur, from some of the firms you've invested, oh God, the failure rate for small startups or for small cryptocurrencies, as we all know is very, very high. So I'm going to finish with then we started the conversation was one more point that.

It's again, it's trader story. There. There's something I call the green lumber fallacy is after the following the following a metaphor, there's a trader who is a fellow who wrote a book on how I lost a billion million dollars, which at the time when he wrote his very respectable million dollars was a lot of money.

Okay. Now, you know, they didn't have a Obama the Obama years and Greenspan. Okay. So how did he lose that million dollars? He traded green lumber and he knew everything about green lumber. He knew the statistics, uh, the physics, chemistry, everything, the supply and demand, the geography, the consumption. He knew everything about green lumber read every magazine, every book he could find on lumber and let he lost all his money turned out.

There was an, a pit, a fellow, an alternate. Who was very, very wealthy and always made money, creating green lumber. He traded nothing else. And one day the narrator discovered that that fellow thought that green lumber was not freshly cut lumber, that it was lumber, that they took lumber and painted it green.

Right. And yet he made a fortune using green lumber. So what does it tell us? It tells us that from the outside, like an academic, when approaching a problem, what you need to know, it's not that it's not what the fellow who made a lot of money. I think Siegel something like Jerry Siegel or something like that, was that what he knew was not like, it's not like he didn't know anything.

He knew a lot of stuff, but that stuff can only detect from the inside. You can never know from the. What is it? You say you have to play the game tender, play the game to know what you need to know. Okay. From the inside, not from the outside, people are always asking me to recommend a game theory textbook.

And the reality is I've never read a game theory textbook. When I was young, I just played a lot of games. Okay. There you go. So you, you, from, from, from being in that game, you see things differently, which is why education. I think an antifragile and hopefully we'll discuss that. And anti-fragile I rail against education.

And then finally, my final slide and we're going to stop the start. The conversation, uh, is, uh, about the following. The following quiz, uh, applies to any business where the, where the risks going in the game say, you'll go to a hospital for your brain surgery. You need to have a brain surgery, which probably will enhance your.

Your mathematical skills. There's a special surgery. All right. You go, you can do integrals after that surgery, right? So you show up to the hospital and you had the choice between two doctors. The first one, it looks like what Hollywood here would put them in a movie, you know, measured, clear English, a Harvard degree on the wall.

Someone who really looked like a Hollywood doctor, Hollywood version of a doctor, a brilliant surgeon, and the other person, same ranked in the hospital. It looks like that. It looks like a butcher thick fingers, no diploma on a wall and speak with a thick New York accent. Okay. You can put them in a mafia movie figure from somewhere.

All right. So, and no diploma on the wall means he's embarrassed by his background. Which doctor should you rationally pick? Who would pick the butcher? Who would pick the slick call your doctor? There you go. So the point is unconditionally, you should pick the heart of the Hollywood doctor, right? But here they're are the same rank in the university.

So think about it. The person who looks the least like a doctor, got to have the most skills because he had to overcome the perception bias against him. Yeah. There's, there's a similar learning in early stage investing where you tend to avoid teams that look incredibly polished, have good PowerPoints.

They're well dressed. They present. Well, what you want is the person who's been busy in front of the computer. Flustered gets up in front of a whiteboard, explains things a little too complicated, but has the genuine substance exactly what the form alone lets you avoid it. So you'll get business plans that are too well.

And they use too many buzzwords and you reject them just on that basis. I would argue, I would take it one step further and argue against the business plan. Anybody who's capable of writing a business plan, you're the one that's best for them.

So, okay. So now let's start the conversation before we get into it, given this theme of proper introduction, because I should have done that at the beginning, but I didn't know if was to be part of the presentation. I normally have a rule, but I don't travel for conferences. And neither probably should you, because they fall very much on this whole side of signaling, right?

Where you're kind of like looking busy for your boss rather than actually doing work. Now, there can be huge benefits. You can network with the right people when they're small, you can meet the right people, but sitting in an audience doesn't have that much value for you. You can sit at home and watch it on YouTube.

So I normally don't travel for conferences, but when I got the opportunity to speak with Nasim, I had to come down from San Francisco. To me, he is one of the very, very few living natural philosophers, which is someone who practices science does real work. But outside of a scientific institution outside of the credential system.

And I think his work is the kind of work that will last for a thousand years. I don't say that, but I think, I think people will be reading their books that Ms. Siemens joking, and I won't insult him by calling him Dr. . Is that okay? I'll just call you assaulted. Yeah, you'll be calling you Dr. Teller, but the same has written books that I think people will be reading a thousand years from now.

His new book skin in the game is fantastic. It's part five in his intertoto series, which includes full by randomness black Swan antifragile. The better procrastination it's written in a very timeless way. The concepts are very simple. There's not a lot of math to it. Although there is a huge math backing to the interpreter.

If you want to get into it. And I would, I would rather reread his work than anything on the best seller lists. And I have many of his books. I've re-read now the interesting thing is that I do get pushback when I say I'm talking to the same. Cause people say, well, he's so angry. He's so he's so mean he's so rude because they can't, they can't fight him on the math and they can't fight him on the principles.

So they go after just the no, no. It's also that I think I derive a huge amount of pleasure from Twitter fights. Yes he does. So why does it drive pleasure from Spotify? So think about it. If you're bored, it wakes you up at the gym, you see I'm weightlifting and you have to take 15 minute breaks to incense.

Yeah. And I think it's not perfect. You say that you do for fun, but I think it's also, it's having skin in the game, in your principles, right? Because as you're saying, courage is the only virtue that cannot be faked. I can fake any virtue. But the one that I can't fake as courage, and that means going up under your name, under some troll account name and taking on somebody that you think has unfairly benefited from exploiting the system like the Bob Rubin trade, for example, or the IO is the intellectual yet idiot that you call out and name, or when you call that Monsanto and he's, he's, he's giving me too much credit.

Right? I just don't do it because of these mistakes to fight. I do it because I get bored. Right. And sometimes waiting in line in traffic when you're stuck in traffic, that's the best time for Twitter fight. So it really is not, it's not as lofty goal, but it so happened that okay. It can impress, well, I know a lot of people that will take on Saudi Arabia on Twitter and call themselves a barbarian, a barrier on a regular basis.

Um, but anyway, so I am, I'm very happy to be here with miss seam. I think the books are absolutely worth reading. If you haven't read all five of his books, I wouldn't read anything else this year. I would literally just absorb them. And I don't say that lightly. That's true for me. Like I'm going through, he's got to convince me to buy three of my books now.

They're, they're amazing. The first one was finished 20 years ago. So you've got to understand that. Um, well there is some redundancy in there as, as you would expect. And I think the common theme that Nassim pointed out to me when we talked earlier running through the whole thing is this concept of symmetry and asymmetry skin in the game is about symmetry between your consequences of your actions and learning and feedback loops and asymmetry is about extreme outcomes.

So, uh, you know, black Swan and, and those kinds of principles. Um, so I think we can, we can just dive in to explain to them the symmetry. I'm sorry, I didn't put slides on symmetry or open if you want me to explain it to them or, yeah, let's go ahead and listen. Why don't you explain symmetry and asymmetry.

Okay. So now you don't understand random events. You can't predict what's going to happen, but you can pretty much tell how the random event would hit you now. You know, whether you're going to make from it, lose from it, make a lot, lose a lot. Okay. So you try to position yourself in a way to benefit more than you would lose from an random event.

Okay. Or to lose less than your neighbor from random event. That's, that's the idea of a cemetery. It's pretty much like an option. What I call an option, an option. You make more on the upside than you. Wouldn't on the downside. And if you inject or in general, make more from a random event, then you lose from it.

Then you got to do very well in the long run provided you. Make sure you're going to survive. That's a cemetery that's present and contracts and options, stuff like that. That cemetery becomes bad when you make the upside like Bob Rubin. And transfer the downside to someone else. And the easiest thing to transfer to person transfer to the taxpayer anonymous, taxpayer C.

So that is an S cemetery. Okay. The bad the cemetery, but thinkers, trial, and error. It is, has a really a positive as cemetery. So the simple example I would give is if we wanted, what's your favorite dish? Uh, it's pizza, but I shouldn't be eating it, but I shouldn't be eating it. Okay. So pizza. Okay. So is say we decide to make the best pizza that would call it the Santa Monica flying pizza right here.

So you, you, you, you, you rent a bus, you go to the local university and bring every chemist, run up every chemist you can find. Okay. And then you take another bus and round up every overweight person, you can find an. Who's well-dressed this is my metric. When you go to a restaurant, is the lookout for overweight people who are well-dressed, that's sort of like a, you know, my, my, my thing.

So, and then, so we have two crowds now. Okay. So if we ask the chemist, the set top down, okay. To, uh, invent that pizza. Yes. It chemistry about 150 chemists, all looking boring and poorly fed and visibly not well-dressed. And, and then you ask the well-dressed people, whatever, and overweight, you tell them, listen, uh, let's make the best pizza.

So the way you do it is you take an existing recipe and you start adding ingredients to it now, and you taste. If it's good, you're accurate. Okay, so you have the upside. If it's good, you discover something that really has good taste, you go up or you rush it up. In other words, you lock up your game. Okay.

Know if it's bad, do you give it to the chemist, have very little to lose, right? So that is trial and error, a lot of trial and error. And I showed an antifragile and that's the main argument that trial and error will always outperform design simply because of that property that we're vastly more intelligent.

We have an IQ of a thousand when we do trial and error. Yeah, this is basic. These basic concepts, by the way, are cropping up all over in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. That is literally a lot of your principles realize like Bitcoin, for example, it's an asymmetric bet. If you lose, you just lose your money.

If you win, if it becomes digital gold, you can make 50 times or a hundred times your money. That obviously it depends on what price you buy. If you buy it for sure, a hundred thousand, maybe not if you buy it for here, maybe, but it's also anti-fragile in the sense that every time it survives a hack or an attack or a failure of some part of the ecosystem, the developers improve the code, they improve the system and then it gets better and better at surviving future shocks.

So this idea of symmetry, it would say convexity because a convex function very simply makes you make more. When you go up, then you lose when you go down. Okay. And it links to fragility is anti-fragile because fragile, that has exact opposite attributes. You say, if I jumped from 10 meters, I get I'm hard.

More than twice. That if I jumped from five meters and more than 10 times, if I jumped one meter and more than a hundred times. So if this concave, it means you don't like volatility. And if you're a convex during that range, you like, ultimately you'd rather have also, you'd rather have sharks. You'd rather have turmoil.

So this is the idea of antifragile, which applies to both the physical system and anthropology. It's like, uh, people who are, who are shorting cryptocurrencies. They're on the wrong side of that. They're doing concave. Yeah. Concave trade. Yeah, because you have a lot more downside than, I mean, think of Paul Krugman, various at what?

40, sorry. He was bearish at 40. He was short. Imagine his PNL if you want short at 40. Okay. Think about it. First of all, would never hear us 100 X disappeared. I had a P and L so this is why, you know, I'm glad that he didn't because we want to just have someone to make fun of. Right. So surprisingly, he doesn't engage me in Twitter.

Because, um, simply he doesn't, for some reason, he, he, he tax other people, but not, for some reason, he, doesn't easier to attack people from behind the shield of the New York times is to go out and it, they don't by the way. Um, so I saw a copy of it as a skin in the game was open as a bestseller to one of our seller list without a single book review, not a single book review in America, in the United States zero.

Okay. Just to tell you that we don't really need the New York times becoming, uh, in my industry. What's funny is people give out awards like VC of the year or angel of the year and so on. And they're all nonsense because the reward is an investing in making the money, you know, like who wants to, who wants to win the award for Bitcoin or the year?

You just want to own the Bitcoin. Right? So, so there are a couple of things we're going to talk about the Lindsey. Yeah. Linked to fragility, like the test of time. Yeah, the Lindy, but let me first say one property of the news that that was, that was, that's not, you know, never existed before in history before 1940, where or 1946.

I think when, when, when families had a television set, so you have a small family now watching television getting one way information, reading the New York times, you don't go to the square, you don't get it. Okay. Before that period of time, people did not get the news from one source. The, it was like Facebook or Twitter.

People traditionally were both conveyors and recipient of the news. So we're all involved in the newsmaking you see? So you got to the Barbara, you get the news, you go and you transmit it. You, you tell the Fisher, uh, fishermen, the counter, then you tell your barber, uh, bring back information to the barbers.

That was so, so news were, uh, something that was organically spread in society. And it was, nobody could control it no, as a source. Okay. Before the 1940s, propaganda, New York times, all that, all that era of television. And we broke out of it was Twitter and social media. So, and there's a concept called Lindy and the news the way, you know, it was organized during that period from 1946 to the election of 2016 was not Lindy can explain to them what Lindy yeah.

Lindy just means sort of stands the test of time, which is like any book that's been around for thousands of years is likely to be around for thousands of more years. Uh, the best predictor of the survivability of something is how long it has survived for something that I'll learn things for things in the intellectual domain for things.

So, so it was discovered Lindy is a restaurant in New York that has cheesecake and it was a horrible cheesecake. And I spoke about it and discussed it in skin in the game. And it had the great idea to go bust on the Tuesday. The very same day, it's kind of a game was published right after 60, 70 years. So Lindsay was the restaurant or actors used to meet and they discovered that plays that survived 200 days had 200 more days, thousand days, a thousand more days that discovers that rule.

So you can classify things on whether they're Lindy or not. Now Lindy tells you that technology okay, is going to be. Uh, all technology will outlive short technologies and new technologies. Not because new technologies are bad, but there'll be more vulnerable new technologies to other newer technologies work for example, is a piece of technology.

That's become invisible to us, but it is technology and how to something that helps you eat things. And the force is going to be around forever. It's a tree, it's a tried and true model. And the fact that it's been around thousands of years means it'll be around for thousands of years. There's something in blockchain, the concept of transaction, coupled with a commercial transaction, coupled with a financial transaction, that's entirely Lindy.

And that's a, the letter of credit, which itself was replicating. Something used in maritime commerce. In other words, the, the banking, they devise the system by which you can, you trigger a currency, basically the minute the you deliver the merchandise. Now you go there with a murder. When merchandise you come back with.

So mixing the physical transaction with a financial one, all in one it's the same transaction, coupling them is an altar, a very old thing in a crypto like Bitcoin is the Lindy currency. It's survived a long time, survived the longest, and it won't be digital gold until it's survived long enough, but the longer it survives, the longer it will survive.

The more faith people can put in it. And the more money they can put it. Exactly. And government issued currencies has not never been Lindy for people. People don't realize. And you can, you can, you can get a clear idea for his history. Okay. The, the, you know, the story of the, remember the story of the Christ and the temple.

Why did he, uh, fight the money changers? Who, why were they money changers in the temple? Because God. The nut, like all these currencies isn't trust these kineses. He wanted the shekel of tire and now current they in finisher are okay because they're the only reputable ones. So he forced cities to force cities to compete on.

Who's going to have the more solid currency for the guard to take it. And then money changes would change into that shackle of tire. So God's currencies have always debate. I mean, government have already based on currency and, and, but yet the citizens had the choice between currencies, currency, how use and what would God want?

He would select the one that was the least debased. Well, you pointed out that one of the big things in history was separating the state from church. Uh, and some religions have done that in some haven't where they still combine them, but that was a major revolution render unto Caesar. What is. Um, and the interesting thing with crypto is we're trying to separate money from the state and that transition, if it successfully happens will probably be just as impactful and take quite a while.

Play out. It is interesting because if you start having competition between crypto currencies, it would be the same competition. The one that prevailed in ancient times between issuers, because, you know, the, the, there was a stutter of, uh, an Asia minor. This, each king produced his or her own currency. And then you'd go buy the one that was the least prone to the basement, right?

The one you can have faith in opinion. It's good to have the competition though, because it makes them antifragile exactly. Exposing them to randomness and execution and mix them all. Yeah, it's not until recently that we forced, you know, you can only conduct transactions and a pestle dollar and this and that.

You've got to convert in the past. People pick the currency. That was the most reliable. Four transactions. Yeah. Another, another point in asymmetry that you brought up, which I thought was very counterintuitive, at least for me, and completely changed the way I think about many important things in the world is the minority rule.

I don't think that one's obvious at all. It's one of the things that maybe it's obvious in hindsight, once you fully understand it, but I think the repercussions aren't obvious and the fact that even is a pretty stable outcome. Isn't very obvious. So I'd love for you to just go through the minority rule.

Okay. It, uh, I discovered that minority rule one day,

ironically, I was trying to explain what a complex system was at a barbecue or the complex system Institute. Okay. And, and that complex system have one attribute that, uh, you at different scales things behave differently. Okay. So in other words, a collection of individuals don't behave like separate individuals.

They behave as separate. Read a separate animal, which is something that a lot of people don't understand in government today is that if I understood the psychology of each person in this room, I can't predict the collective how they would behave collectively. Okay. But nurses know that people know that from children.

Right. You know, you could predict each child independently, we've put them together. It's unpredictable. Okay. So different animal. So that's a concept of a complex system trying to explain it. Okay. Dope. I was hit with the best example with a complex system, because that was, um, uh, okay. There's, you know, we've had food, all right.

And drinks and, uh, delegation came from Jerusalem and they're all Orthodox, right. Bunch of people. So a fellow, um, you know, to say hello, and I felt embarrassed. I said, oh, I'm so sorry. We don't have kosher. He looks at me. He said, oh, miss our kosher here. I said, what said, yeah, what'd you buy the drinks here in Boston.

Okay. I'm going to be kosher. What I Googled the proportion of kosher eaters and drinkers in America point less than 0.3%. That's on a good day, right? On a religious holiday 0.3% yet close to a hundred percent of drinks in America are kosher. Why is that? So simply because it's used around the world, sorry I was this do not quote me on that.

It'd been filmed. You mean film is because it's very simple concept. If it's, let's say Coca Cola, where are you going to have kosher Coca Cola? Non-kosher Coca-Cola all right. You're going to have different departments, different things, different trucks. So we don't get mixed. And then supermarkets will have different, uh, uh, aisles.

This is Portia. You make them all kosher. Okay. Those were like. Don't know the difference. Okay. We'll drink. Coca-Cola I don't drink Coca-Cola okay. Was so it's so happened that when we looked at the bottom of the lemonade bottle, there was a science saying it was kosher that only the kosher people know how to identify.

Okay. So that's the minority role. So if a margin came from space and sampled food preferences, okay. He would say that Americas are a hundred percent kosher wonderings. Okay. Not points 3%. So why there's an SME tree? The cautious person will never drink, not kosher, but the non-kosher. Yes, it can drink culture.

Yeah. That's the key that role, but the minority to control the majority, the minority has to be intransigent. They have to be absolutely unwilling to be unwilling, to do that. So for example, people didn't notice one thing about the preferences, marketing preferences, they don't understand. They look at marketing preference of individuals and they make cars accordingly.

Most Americans at a time when cars were still has stick-shift preferred, stick-shift the majority 75%. But most of them had a family member who didn't like stick shift. Right? So your family of five and one family member at a time that people didn't have a lot of cars per household, one household member can drive.

So what do you do is going to go it's like if someone in the house has a peanut allergy or gluten allergy, exactly. Full house with no food or no peanuts. So there's nothing wrong with accommodating the minority so long as you know it. Now, the interesting thing about the minority rule, that seems to me that it's a norm rather than the exception in society and about anything.

The reason we have non-smoking spaces, I joked with a friend of mine. One day I had a French visitor when I was a student and he came and met me. I said, meet me in front of this restaurant and booked a table. He couldn't find a non-smoking table. I told him, did you try the smoking one? He said, yeah. I said, okay, go buy a pack of cigarettes and we'd go to the smoking section.

He believed, he thought that, you know, you're forced to smoke in the smoking section. So we smoked it, a smoking section to be there, to play the game. So, but really you have these cemeteries actually running. Yeah. And acclimation of ethics. This is very, this is very interesting for me because like on Twitter, for example, if you go on there, you always find somebody who's outraged about something right there.

There's somebody in the extreme left or the extreme right. In politics or in crypto land. And they're just really, really angry about something. And for a while they thought they were just being super ineffective. And that's what I was hoping. I was hoping that the most outraged, most angry people are actually very ineffective and they're just misguided and they're kind of on the corner.

But the sad thing is the minority rule kind of shows that if these people are intransigent enough, they actually run and control society. They established the laws for the rest of us. And we kind of intuitively know this, like from revolutions, like revolutionaries tend to be small bands, small groups that won't put up with the status quo that overthrow the entire system.

Because most people in the center just kind of don't care. They just kind of want to get along and they want to go along. So this comes back to like, if you're willing to tolerate it. Then you've got to live with the consequences. If you look at, for example, elections, there is a belief in politics and political science that is the voter in the center, the median voter, who everybody competes for and decides how the election runs.

But that's not true when you have third parties with intransigent minorities. So for example, if the Bernie voters absolutely will not vote for the mainstream Democrat, the Clinton, or if the extreme right voters won't vote for the Jeb Bush, then they'll actually stay home or they'll vote for third party.

You actually have to appeal to them. You have to go with them as a center, as long as there's enough of them. It doesn't have to be a large enough number. It's just a few percentage points and they're enough to control the entire. So we live in a world that is actually structured around the preferences of radicals, who won't compromise.

It's not, it's not built around, around the will of the majority, the world. The majority does apply in some cases, but in many more cases, it's the minority rule. And there are all kinds of other implications. I mean, ethics, for example, you had the illusions that society is getting more ethical because the majority is becoming more ethical.

No, no, no, no, no. It's minority role. Another mistake made by Monsanto that when introducing GMOs, they thought that all the third was convincing 51% of consumers to have GMOs. They did not think it through properly, because think about it. All you need is 3% of people who are absolutely against eating GMOs.

All right. And then you're going to have a party here to celebrate. Collapse of say solidarity, barbarians say, okay, we have a party. All right, what do you do? You send the, let's say GMO, no jam. We make everything non GMO, make everything organic. And the difference in price, when the differences price is small, everybody switches to the one that the minority wants.

So the choice of the minority, one different surprises, large, then it may have two varieties. Like for example, for meat, kosher meat and kosher stuff is much more cumbersome to have everything kosher because it's more costly and it's okay. Right? So there's the evidence of the Jews around the world. But, but, but, but believe it or not a hundred percent of the meat you get imported meat imported the lab in the United States about a hundred percent is because New Zealand exports.

Okay. The main exporter, let me say, what is it going to do? What is it? Put it in a ship to Malaysia, or what if, what if Malaysia doesn't want, there's less demand  for Senator United States. So they made everything hell out. So all their meters, all their exports are allowed. So at Christmas I saw this as Christmas Halala because I can detect, I read Arabic.

Yeah. So it was probably, you know, they produce it and there, we don't have to worry about merchandising about perishability and stuff like that to make it, make everything how it's much simpler. A minority rule applies when the minority is not willing to compromise when it's relatively distributed amongst the whole population.

Like if they're off by themselves in a corner, then maybe you can service them just as a minority and leave. If you have a geographic diversity, okay. Then you don't have a north euros. Right? If you say the people who live in the neighborhood culture live in the neighborhoods have their own ecosystem, then, then you'd have.

You want to have a north year-olds as you open up the country and the minority will look prevail about anything and conditional on the majority not being ticked off by it. That's right. Okay. That's in Europe, for example, now pretty much schools have to have Halaal meat and you have reaction. People didn't know.

I mean, you should have done it in a more quiet judicious way. Yeah. But because a parent has to say, no, I refuse that my child is Halla. Okay. Now we have the reaction, just like the Christians and, um, and the enrollment world. Hello meat resembles all sacrificed meat and, and, and, and the near east, actually you have to sacrifice no, the cow or the land, the sheep in a certain way.

And Christian would, would never eat sacrificial meat. You know, in the old times, pagans would have sacrificed with meat and there's a lot of pushers will die. In front of a table full of meat, just to show that they were Christian and they would not eat sacrificial meat because for them it's polluted.

So you may have a counter counter minority rule coming into somewhere you say. Yeah, I think for, there are cases where the minorities themselves are and minority here, obviously, you know what it means? It means a small group of people who are intransigent themselves are very intolerant of maybe even the existence of the majority or the way the majority of function.

So it does create a counter reaction. So it's not that all revolutionaries necessarily control the world, or very often it does get lynched or stamped out. Exactly. So we have a sin balance here between majority rule and minority rule and Tocqueville wanted to protect the minority from the majority. All right.

And now we may have to do the inverse of feel as well to bring cemetery protect the majority from the minority. Yeah. It applies in crypto. For example, if, imagine that. I don't know if I had to make up a number, like call it like 10 or 20% of the good developers in Silicon valley are now working on crypto related projects or at least dabbling on it.

And if they all announced tomorrow that they'll only going to work for companies that pay them in crypto, then pretty soon you would see every payroll system switched to also offering. Yeah, that's true. If you're a, if you're unconditional about getting or paying or receiving in crypto, you're you, you installed them in north hero.

So minority rule is a very powerful concept. It's one of the ones that skin in the game. I highly encourage you to go through it. Um, let's talk a little bit about black swans, which is an old concept. You're very famous for it. Did you coin the term? No. Black Swan term was the earliest use of it was by a Roman poet who said that a good person is as rare as a black Swan and it was used for something, uh, you know, uh, rare, but not completely.

Yeah. And now, now we see them everywhere. Now that you've kind of popularized it. I think it's very, it's very good. She's a member because we use it as a, as a, uh, a logical problem is that, uh, no matter how many, how many white swans you've seen, you cannot rule out the black Swan. Right. But there's an assymetry.

If you've seen one black Swan, then, then you can say that they are, it's kind of like how science works to completely prove anything. You can only do. They get the fireballs. You've got to be disciplined, disproved, disproved. Right? So anytime somebody says, this is proven by science, they're usually don't understand it.

Yeah. They don't understand. Or they work for Monsanto or the ex Monsanto. They're the ones that say it's proven by science. Science is not about proving science is about disproving and having something that has not been producing a result that has not yet been disproved or superseded by something else.

So it's the process, not the result, but science is a minority rule by the way. Yeah. Yeah. Science. When someone tells you a 300 Nobel prize winner said this, okay, That doesn't count because one counter example can destroy the whole argument, right? Consensus, consensus doesn't matter the worst by minority, but the system is there to protect that minority.

That is right against the majority, except in economics of great. It's like a, it was a Galileo who said, but yet it moves when he was pushed. It was

very interesting related concept that you've tried to bring in the mainstream, which I don't think has quite gotten mainstream yet is ergo diversity. I don't think most people understand it. I think it's one of the more complicated concepts. I think I finally do understand it, but I'd love to have you explain it and see if we can spread the name of that.

I want to explain one thing, one thing that a rule, if called pass dependence, if you wash your clothes first and then iron them say, wash your pants and then you get different results. From a few Ireland, your past first then wash them. Okay. So the sequence matters. No. Okay. So it's trivial, but you need to analyze things dynamically to get that point.

So skin in the game really is organized around two concepts. Things seen statically that when you view them dynamically have completely different properties. And you can only get that if you're either super smart, mathematically, which nobody is or have skin in the game, because you realize that. So if you go to a casino and you have a small, probably blowing up, no matter what your edge is, you will blow up.

That's it. So no matter what you're, because you cannot say, okay, I'm going to blow up and then get rich. You can't, you got to get rich, then blow up. So the sequence matters. So that is that past dependence. This is the reason why we're paranoid. And I noticed that there's a guy who got the Nobel sailor, pseudo, Nobel, and economic that shouldn't count should count as a negative.

Right? So, and then all his work is based on showing how we're irrational statically. Okay. He, for example, in one of his, the example where we showed irrational, if you go to the casino and play with the house money in the sense that you bet small and that you win big, if you win big, then you risk big. But if you lose, you don't take risks.

So in other words, your initial endowment, you try to preserve it, but you risk everything you make from it. Okay. He found that irrational, but if you look at it dynamically, that's what every trader does you play with a house? If you don't follow such a strategy, you're eventually going to go bust one day, right?

Because you can't say, I can look at the average return because if you're bust on day 28, there is no day 29. You see, whereas if you take an average of people's returns, if number 28 goes bust number 29, you know, can operate freely. So that concept of past dependence was not incorporated into the psychology of decision-making.

And then therefore they found that were irrational in many places where in reality, we're not because if you look at things in sequence, you see, so you got to always look at things in sequence, not look at things, right? So like a lot of, uh, behavioral psych studies and, and, and, uh, economic studies will say that, uh, if I offered you a billion dollars to play Russian yeah.

Right. And six people play, play Russian roulette. Well, five out of the six make a billion dollars each. So assuming that your value of your life is lower than a billion dollars, you will play Russian once, but would you one person play Russian roulette six times, right? No. So confusing those two, the probability of a group going once each versus an individual, taking all of the risks and sequence, it gives you completely different answers.

And there's this concept, which I'm sure you've all heard of loss, aversion, where, you know, people are irrationally loss averse. No, they're not irrationally loss versus they're rational loss averse. Because if you go bust, you can never recover. So like, for example, in your crypto asset, accumulation and trading, if you go super short and you sell everything and you'll lose everything, you'll never get to get back in the game.

You have to stay in the game. And it's kind of an obvious concept once it's explained and described, but there are entire books written out. There's the Kelly criterion and Fortune's formula that book. But yeah, only traders and mathematicians who do information theory or computer science get the point like Kelly, Shannon and Shannon entropy.

They get the point that you got to look at things dynamically, but psychology is so naive and they keep getting Nobels, you know, they're naive by saying we're irrational to be paranoid. They don't understand you. You, you, you know, dynamically. If we were not paranoid, wouldn't be here. We wouldn't be here.

Okay. So you cannot analyze one event. You've got to see how that event is going to shorten your life expectancy. So there's some classes of risk you should never be taking. And effectively when you take Goldman Sachs have been around 159 years, you may hate them. I hate him, but you got to admire how they stayed life, why they never take a risk of ruin.

And that's the same thing. As a lesson I had as a trader by an old trader who came and told me, listen, take all the risks of your clan, but make sure you're hitting tomorrow. So make sure you survive. So it tells you that you got to gear your risk-taking first or survival, and that entails you take more risks as you make more money with the casino money.

And that called mental accounting is deemed the rational and being paranoid is deemed the rational because they only look at a single event, not series of events. And there's something has been happening now with psychologists in the middle of replication crisis. And there are papers don't replicate.

And those that replicate don't really have the same effect. So was tells us that whatever they call science is vastly outperformed by your grandmother. So if you go ask your grandmother, particularly she's have Mediterranean wisdom, I'm biased. All right. So Mediterranean or some kind of Russian Russian, particularly, but the babushkas at the very ask grandmothers, right?

So, or grandparents or grandfathers. They will, whatever they will tell you will be. Lindsey will have survived the test of time. And if psychologist agree with your grandparents, okay. Maybe they're right. If they bring something new that your grandparents didn't know, Azar is going to be suspicious. Yeah.

Any field where you need to add the word science to the end to make it seem legit probably is not exactly. Exactly. So just if we were to summarize, because there's, time's up, time's up a flash, but possession is nine-tenths of the loss. So, so, so until the audience leaves we're here now. So to wrap things up here, I was saying anti-fragile and in the skin of game, there are two things that are wrong.

When you know, plasma Naveli is a scale. A large country is not like a small cities that you blow up. Singapore is not like a small. And likewise, a group of people act differently. That's complexity. And the second one is with time on the repeated behavior, you have to have complete different strategies from the static ones.

And that was detected by practically every grandparent and people have skin in the game. So that that's sort of the mess local message from skin in the game. And the overall message is my message. Before you conclude, is the idea of the insert is that there's a lot of uncertainty out there that a lot of stuff we don't know, but the good news is that there's only one and one way to go about it.

Okay. And it's quite interesting to see that the moral certainty there is take global warming. There's a lot of uncertainty because there's a high probability that the IPC that could follow. Okay. And there's a probability that their, that their opponents are full of crap. Right. But the more certainty the, there is in the system, the less you want to pollute because you don't know what's going on.

Right. So interestingly, the more our certainty there exist in the system. Okay. The more you got to follow it, follow a certain paranoid route, try to position yourself to have more upside than downside and effectively your decision become much easier. So let's not waste time trying to argue about the niceties of the future, because the more our sincerity there is the more we know how to act.

So that's sort of the idea of the circle in general. Well, I recommend everybody just devour all of the scenes books. It'll improve your decision making in life and crypto and put pressure on me, figuring out even like which doctor you should go to, which restaurant you should eat at, how you should conduct yourself, honorably, honorably, and morally.

Um, I think it's a, it's an amazing work and I hope he keeps putting them out. It's not the last one. I don't know if you, if you keep talking like this, I'll stop. All right. Thank you everyone. Great. Thanks very much. .
