![[y2mate.com - Decentralizing Everything with Ethereums Vitalik Buterin  Disrupt SF 2017.mp3]]


Hi everyone. Um, so thanks for having us this morning. Uh, it sounds like you're spending a hundred million dollars to find, uh, aliens and we have one here. Um, and earlier in the extraordinary ability, um, most of you probably know a little bit about Vitalik. I'm not going to go through his whole bio.

That's what Google's for, but just as a quick, uh, interesting background or note, I discovered cryptocurrencies in 2013 and for me. It brain virus is kind of the best way to describe it. When you first understand the concept is sort of all you can think about. And in the four year subsequent, all I managed to do was invest a little bit here and there.

Write a little bit about it and just try and understand it in that period of time in late 2013 Vitalik, very young at the time, 18, 19. How old were you when I created a Sirium yeah, 1990. Yeah. Years old conceived of the project. Tried to build it on top of Mastercoin spun it out as his own. And created what is the most exciting project in the space since the Toshi Nakamoto, whoever that is originally created Bitcoin, and as you all hopefully know, it's a platform for distributed applications in a trustless secure, decentralized way.

And we're going to talk a little bit more about what that means. We'll try and keep it very high level because I understand this is a general idea. Um, but yeah, without further ado, here's Vitalik. Um, and we're going to talk a little bit about Ethereum, so please give him a big welcome

maybe we'll just start very high level in your own words. How would you describe if Ethereum to the average person, why it's important? Yeah. So, first of all, there's two kinds of average people. There is the average person who has already heard of Bitcoin and there's the average person who hasn't. Right.

So, I mean, for the first category, it's a bit easier because if you understand what Bitcoin is and you understand that it's a to peer digital currency and you, and you were stands that if you wants to have a digital currency, that's decentralized. Then the, like you need some kind of database to store how much money everyone has, right?

Like if I have a hundred new digital Bitcoin dollars or digital, whatever cash, and I send a hundred to you, and I also send the same hundred to someone. Then there was our two transactions, either one of which is illegal wire itself, but both of which are illegal in combination because they'd be turning a hundred units of cash into 200, and this is the classic double spending problem.

And in order to solve it, you basically need to have some system that keeps track of have these coins already been spent. How much money do I actually have at any given time? How much money do I have the right to spend at any given time? And you can very easily do this with a centralized. But if you wants to do this in a way that's decentralized, which has, you know, Bitcoin's original points in the spirit of things like BitTorrent, it's actually a very hard computer science problem to figure out how to do it.

And Satoshi Nakamoto probably came up with a first solution that really is practical in this kind of open permissionless context, which has Nakamoto. And that was where the idea of watching the technology in general came from now. We, our theory, um, comes from is basically you take that idea, the idea that you can use, what I call crypto economics.

So a combination of cryptographic algorithms, things like hashing and digital signatures and the kinds of economic incentive as they keep systems like Bitcoin going and use them. Create these kind of decentralized networks with memories. So these kinds of decentralized database, like things for a whole bunch of other applications as well.

Right? So around 2013, people started realizing really that these blockchains are usable for much more than peer to peer digital currency. And the first major thing aside from Bitcoin was probably named coin, which was trying to do a peer to peer decentralized DNS, but then people started. No, can you do other kinds of digital assets?

Can you use smart contracts? Can you do a financial agreements? Can you do registries about identity? Can you do all these other things? And there were so many applications that building a blockchain for each one, it doesn't really work. And so the core idea behind the theory is, you know, you can have a general purpose blockchain.

We can have a blockchain where instead of the blockchain working like us with army knife, where you have, you know, five different tools for five different categories of applications. You have a blockchain that understands a general purpose programming language. So, you know, kind of like your phone, you know, in your phone, you have Android or iOS and inside of Android or inside of iOS, you can have apps.

The apps are written in whatever programming language they're written in. Anyone can create an app, anyone can download an app and run it. So that was the kind of general purpose flexibility I was trying to blink to bring to the blockchain. Yeah, it's amazing. The, the concept of a Turing complete blockchain and the computer science speak that can execute any arbitrary program.

Given enough resources is pretty incredible. Yeah. And it seems daunting because the idea of a blockchain is that everybody, one of the implementation of the blockchain, that everybody executes a copy of the code on themselves to verify that what is supposed to happen actually. So that begets a whole slew of problems, like scaling and trust and, uh, and so on, but just kind of easing into that.

What kinds of applications do you think, and if they're in blockchain is suited well for like the applications you have both have people building today and ones in the future. Yeah. So I think that there's in a few major categories, so, I mean, anything to do with like, uh, the currency itself is obviously going to be a major category pretty much.

And then you want the security associated with the exact, I mean like currencies seems to be naturally the kind of application that's fairly well-suited because like the general way that I categorize, like applications that are good watching applications is to think of what a blockchain is. Right. So the way I define a blockchain is it's a decentralized system that contains some kind of shared memory.

And no one big wins case. The shared memory is how many Bitcoins everyone has at some time, but it could be. So a good blockchain application is an application. That number one needs decentralization, and number two needs some concept of shared memory. Ian know the case for decentralization in cryptocurrencies themselves, I think is fairly clear, but you can actually even go beyond that.

Right? You can think about if you have these centralized cryptocurrencies, then you can build many other things on top of them. And there was this interesting idea that Nick Sabo came up with about 25 years ago. That was called a smart contract. And he made an analogy to a vending machines, right? So what he said was that a vending machine is a device implemented in physical hardware that basically implements the conditions of some kind of an agreement.

And the conditions of the agreement here are simple. You put $2 in water comes out. You do not put $2 in water does not come out. If you put, if you do not put $2 in, but water does come out. And the vending machine is basically an encoding of this set of rules. And that also comes with, you know, a mechanism that keeps it at least kind of secure and secure enough for $2 water bottles.

Now with a digital assets, you can think about this kind of concept and make and push it much, much further. In the digital world, you know, with, in the world of cryptography, it's this world where even individuals are capable of basically having, having cryptographic defenses that are strong enough to even sometimes ward off state level.

And when you have that kind of security, the possibilities go up, right? So the general notion of a smart contract is that it's like a computer program that directly controls digital assets. Now the kind of direct control here is important, right? It's not a computer program that makes a recommendation to a guy about how the guy should control the digital asset.

It's a computer program that controls the digital asset on Ethereum. You can literally send a bunch of ether into a computer. And once you've done this, the computer program itself has basically the unilateral ability to control, you know, where the money goes. If the computer program sends the money to address a, it goes through a safe, it wants to send it to address via ghost address fee.

And if it doesn't want it to send it anywhere at all, then the money just stays there. And you can see this being used in a bunch of applications. Insurance, just like any kind of self-executing financial contract, you can reduce counterparty risk in a lot of those kinds of applications by potentially are really huge amounts.

I mean, you could imagine it being used for even for more complex things. So there is this idea of DAOs, which are like these entire long running entity, is that hold onto digital assets. They basically use those digital assets in various ways, according to at least on a fairly complex sets of rules. And then you could even imagine, you know, systems for crowdfunding.

So if you think about what Kickstarter does, for example, you know, let's people throw in money. If they thrown in enough money within 30 days, then the money goes to the developer. And if they. They do not send in enough money. Then everyone gets refunded and that's like a set of rules that could be replicated in a piece of code.

Now, outside of the financial world, there's a lot of possibilities as well. So like the DNS is just one simple and natural one. And you know, there is already a system on Ethereum called ENS, the Ethereum name system, and this idea of giving human readable. Where that are in some ways I can not tie to say any kind of issuer is also one that just seems very interesting.

And you could imagine expanding this to identities when you could take this class. So you can replace money. You can replace wall street, you can replace core internet protocols. What else can you do? In fact, I remember I looked at your about me page and it has this funny story. I don't know if it's real or not, but you first saw the power of decentral or at least the demand for decentralized applications.

When your world of Warcraft character had his rules changed on him by a blizzard update. And that annoyed you so much, that you had to go out and build something like Ethereum. So in theory, you could even build a massively multiplayer game on top of Ethereum, where everyone can have the rules verified.

The story is true with all the FA the fact that them nerfing siphon life and leading to me, crying, crying myself to sleep is what led directly to Ethereum is a bit exaggerated. I do encourage you to check out Photonix about new page. It's it's a right. Um, so now obviously, if you're going to replace all of these different systems, you have a scaling issue.

You have to figure out, especially with the centralized mechanism. Even just a handle visas throughput, let alone every imaginable, smart contract. That's not going to work if everyone's running a copy of every program on their computer. So if you look at like just the raw numbers of blockchains today, Bitcoin is currently processing some a bit less than three transactions a second.

And if it goes close to four, then it's already at peak capacity, Ethereum. Over the last few days, it's been doing about five a second. And if it goes above six, then it's also at peak. So on the other hand, you know, Uber on average 12 rides, a second PayPal, several hundred visa, several thousand major stock exchanges, tens of thousands.

And if you want to go up to IOT, then you're talking hundreds of thousands. And if you're you want to go up to non-financial applications. So like for example, there was applied for him called Leroy, which has basically just Twitter on the blockchain. Then, you know, you're talking also about hundreds of thousands, possibly millions.

You know, there is a kind of gap from here to there. And I think right now there already is really a lot of institutional hype in the space and just public hype. So when you have Vladimir Putin, having, you know, knowing what blockchains and Ethereum are and Paris Hilton going out promoting ICO was on Twitter.

But the reason, I think a large part of the reason why a lot of this hasn't materialized into action yet is precisely because of some of these technical obstacles that make blockchains work okay. For some niche use cases, but not really work worked well for me. Now, you know, our team is working very hard on various kinds of scalability solutions.

So you hear about buzzwords, like plasma, sharding, state channels, right? In all, there is various newer ones. Like. Um, so all of these are various different ideas that actually we do each ride. So they kind of break through this fundamental barrier, right? Try to either create blockchains. It's still maintain a large amount of security without requiring everyone to literally process everything.

Right. So if you think about it, one extreme is one guy processes, everything, which is today's world. The other. Everyone processes everything well, what if you can get like square root of everyone? So like maybe 500 people processing each transaction, you still get enough decentralization insecurity for everything you need, but suddenly it's within.

It's efficient enough that, you know, it actually works for, for stuff in the real world. And the other kinds of strategies are strategies. Try to use the blockchain in a kind of more intelligently. Right? Basically one of the analogy is that like Joseph Poon from plasma uses a lot is the idea of the blockchain as a court system.

Right? So blockchains are great at securely resolving. And currently the way naive watching applications work is they just put every single transaction on the blockchain. But what you could do instead is you could have systems where people send messages that I call kind of tickets. So digital, we sign messages that are off chain by default, but we are, the blockchain only gets used in those specific cases where there's a disagreement.

I have a hundred digital and a hundred ether, and I send the, you the a hundred user then that might not ever go off chain. But if I send you the a hundred ether and then you claim that I never sent you the money that, or I claimed that I never sent you the money, then that's a transaction that, okay, we have a dispute and I could actually push it down onto the blockchain.

And so we still have a guarantee of security. Now all of these approaches have their own trade offs and there's this huge amount of incremental technical. Involved in figuring out what the right trade offs are, but, you know, the starts of looking like a direction that's much more promising. And how far along are we, how long until you think that, uh, maybe we can scale to, uh, as you said, hundreds of concurrent users, how many until we can replace visa, how many until we can replace AWS?

I mean, first things like visa, I think definitely. I would say a couple of years. So maybe one year when we start seeing like prototypes that have like a low security level, but are still secure enough for like major organizations to start just doing proof of concepts on and a couple more years for all these solutions to really hit the mainstream for, I mean, AWS is a trickier one because.

I think there are reasons why blockchains are no matter how good they are never going to completely replace centralized cloud computing and probably even more one of the big ones. Well, there's probably two big ones. In my opinion. One big one is that there are computations that are intensive and that our hearts are paralyze.

So decentralized clouds are really good at parallelization because you know, it's like Uber for your laptop. You know, you've got, you got millions of computers from millions of countries, millions of providers, all ranging. Individual laptops too. You know, you can, you can think of even cloud computing companies basically turning into like specialized mining farms inside of the system.

But if you have a computations that require like a really large amount of serial computation, then that's harder to decentralize in the second really tough one is privacy, right? Like if you have computations on private data and then there's basically two approaches, one of them is to make sure the computations are only done on hardware.

And the second one is the USB and secret tography. So you might've heard of buzzwords, like homomorphic, encryption, indistinguishability office location to do the computations, but the, or, but then if you do that, then those tends to carry very serious. Some computational efficiency trade-offs okay. So basically for private or serial applications are going to do them locally?

Yeah, like in general, I think like, there's obviously there's always going to be this large set of applications where decentralized approaches, like actually don't work that well, and that's fine. And so you're, you're essentially building something that we, an operating system and a protocol for the world on the fly.

It's going to take a decade probably to get to full scalability and hopefully adoption. What do you do in terms of the there's a classic operating system developer question that they wonder about just how wide do I go and how high do I go? So do you start adopting other applications into the stack?

All these people are doing. They were building their two tokens on top of Ethereum. Do you see a theory of adopting any of their functionalities or does it stay as a broad wide? Yeah, one of our theories slogans right from the start has actually been, we have no features, right? So like a lot of the other projects are definitely going in that direction.

They're saying, oh, we support this class of new class of transaction for issuing a token. Oh, we support this new class of transaction, that issues an ICO. And what you can have your five parameters with like a cap, like theory, like type of auction. Or whatever, but you know, with the theory, we've never gone down that road, basically for a couple of reasons.

One of them is that, you know, you want the protocol to be maximally simple because simplifying the protocol just improves consensus security. So, you know, the more, the more consensus code you have in the protocol rules, the more likely it is you'll have issue like two different implementations, like not being in sync with each other and waiting to the blockchain, just randomly splitting in half.

Um, the other big re reason of course is just, you know, unknown unknowns. We have really no idea what blockchains are going to be used for like five or 10 years from now. And we don't really want, I mean, we are okay with me NICU, some specialized components that get used a lot. So like in theory, we have a next update metropolis, which is coming in October.

One of the major things that's coming in that is explicit in protocol support for certain kinds of cryptographic. So like ring signatures, elliptic curve pairings, which get used as part of zero-knowledge proofs. So basically the major theme here, basically being like strong cryptography and privacy in like that is kind of specialized, but it's also very generic because almost any application could benefit from privacy.

So we are willing to compromise somewhat in that direction, but we really don't want to compromise in favor of. Really supporting high efficiency in every single application. Now, if that means that there are a specific application categories where some platforms that computer theory, then that's fine.

You know what? We don't needs to be everything to everyone, but there are also going to be ways to kind of specialize even within the Ethereum ecosystem as well. Right? So there's projects like cosmos things like plasma, all of these are trying to provide second layer systems. Connects you with Ethereum.

And in many, in many cases are even designed in order to take advantage of the base of Ethereum blockchain. But like can have properties of their own ans that if they run well, could have, you know, things like a 500 millisecond block time, so you can run StarCraft on the blockchain. So, you know, those things are possible.

And if you adopt this approach where if you have a theory as this kind of base layer, that does, uh, does a good job of balancing between the kinds of the high level of security and the scalability that, uh, basically. And then allows these other things with various different properties to get built on top.

Then you actually can have a blockchain ecosystem that works. Got it. So you want it to be a secure base layer that doesn't have too many features and really lets the innovation happen on top of it. You have things like privacy and security and consensus at that. Hurrell there, but the big application that everyone has obsessed about, in fact, I think the reason.

People are so interested in cryptocurrency these days, just because they're making money off of them. So the fundamental application right now seems to be just money and Bitcoin seems to be willing to the protocol is in service of the currency. And here it seems almost the opposite. Is that fair to say the currency is in the service of the protocol?

Definitely. I definitely say that is our philosophy, although. Yeah, it's definitely the case that there's a lot of adoption purely because of people's speculative interest. But then on the other hand, like that's not, no, that has a bad side and a good side. Right. And I think one of the good side basic good sides really is that in part, because of this, you know, there actually is a lot more interest in the possible social benefits of the essential ice technology.

And there are in many of the other approaches. Been tried to like over the last decade, like if you look at diaspora, great idea ended up failing completely. Right. And you know, like a lot of these kinds of decentralized projects tends to not work very well in an awards part because basically lack of funding and just lack of any kind of good incentive for actually building out the infrastructure, you know, Here in the cryptocurrency lands in obese, you know, there's a lot of money and at least that one particular problem can be solved right now because, or the economics of the crypto, the incentive issues are solved and economic incentives can unite people in a way that pure politics cannot.

Crypto is really ultimately all about incentives on multiple levels from the community, all the way down to intellect the security of the consensus protocol. Like you just cannot reason about security of vanilla, crypto blockchain, consensus protocols, without reasoning about economics. You know, it's not about if you, if you know, like half of these people honest, then we can prove the system is secure or, or, you know, if magic Bob in the sky is honest, we know the system is secure.

The system is secure because we have mathematical proof stuff. Say if the system breaks, then the guy who did it loses a hundred million dollars. Right. So that's what we mean by crypto economics combining together. And it's kind of cryptography, mathematical proofs and economic game theory, reasoning. So, if you assemble all this together, it used to be in God.

We trust that it used to be in nation states. We trust now it's going to be in math. We trust. Are they nation states going to take this line down? You just came back from China. You saw what's happening there. Yeah. And it's in the way that traditional political, just economic powers, they're going to response to all of this.

Definitely going to be, I think a big part of the story over the next few years, if you will, is ultimately, it really does this re-ups traditional power structures and you know, whether it's Washington, New York or Silicon valley, you know, it's, it really does in OPO is post serious challenges to the way that things are, are working now.

But, and on the other hand, it's one of the things we've re we've learned actually. A lot of the people, even inside these power structures seem not all of them, but some of them seem quite friendly to, you know, these ideas of disruption. You know, like there are definitely are plenty of, you know, JP Morgan employees who are really excited about the possibility of blockchain technology and, you know, The fact that you work for a large company or that you work for a government, you know, it doesn't mean, you know, it doesn't mean that you're a hopelessly boring suit, right?

They're like one on one of mine. And fevered examples of there says that in Taiwan, there's a politician named Audrey Tang and she is describing she's transgender. And she describes herself as a conservative anarchist. And yet she is the head of, I believe like the digital ministry of the Taiwanese.

Right. So, you know, like you've given these kinds of people, this is obviously, you know, someone who's particularly special when she has been recognized as one of the 10 and kind of greatest programmers there, but much later degree, lesser degrees, these kinds of kinds of people do exist. And large organization organizations in general are complex.

Right? Now with people with one belief, what kind of belief on one side with another kind of belief on the other side, even if you look at the Chinese government, Lyrica, their response, I think has clearly been a show that, you know, there are different groups of people inside of the government who have different ideas about which direction they wants to go.

And, and, you know, like lately, if you look at all the news about like them regulating VPNs and chat groups and so forth, it's obvious that kind of the arc of this decade is that the conservative side over there is winning. And to be fair, our water, those things are happening in many other places in the way in the world as well.

But. Larger organizations are definitely still diverse. It's amazing. China's finding out that it's financial and capital control policy boils down to its firewall policy. So we could talk for hours. I mean, Vitalik knowledge is incredible here with just scratch. I encourage you to follow him on Twitter, where he's incredibly good natured about all the trolls that are constantly attacking him.

So don't be one of those people, um, and learn everything you can about Ethereum, because it really is very much the future in cryptocurrency. So thank you for having me for being with us Vitalik. After your short trip to China, .
