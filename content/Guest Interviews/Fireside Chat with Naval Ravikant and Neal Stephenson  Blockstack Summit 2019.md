and the Silicon valley in California right now, uh, where I've been an entrepreneur and investor for about two decades, uh, moved there straight out of school, uh, started starting companies because I love science and technology and it technology is the business of science, uh, or applying science. And so I started a couple of companies, uh, one that made optical amplifiers.

Uh, became what is today, Google earth. Uh, one that, uh, was called Epinions when public, as part of shopping.com uh, dozens of failed efforts, things you've never heard of things that you might yet hear of. Um, I started angel list, which is the largest online platform for startup fundraising. We've now raised over a billion dollars, uh, almost all for seed stage.

Uh, we also operate the largest free talent startup recruiting marketplace. We're about half the startups in the English speaking world find talent on there. Um, we own product hunt, which is where companies go to launch their product. Um, we've also, uh, spun up CoinList, which is a giant well lit regulated marketplace for crypto in ICO's.

Uh, I've been an angel investor in companies like Twitter and Uber and wish and Postmates and a bunch of others. Um, coauthored, a blog called venture hacks. Got a little Twitter. Feed, uh, and worked in the jobs act, which was the U S law that enabled crowdfunding general solicitation reggae. Plus IPO's.

Yeah, that's kind of it. I asked, I asked them all to do that. Cause there was no way I was going to do justice to the bio. But, uh, for those who don't know, I mean, Nevada, a bit of a legend and uh, across the world now, and especially in Silicon valley. And so I'm curious from, uh, from your perspective, Nepal, what is the opportunity for New Zealand around our technology ecosystem and what constitutes the elements and the actors in a well-functioning ecosystem?

So, uh, I mean, it's a hard problem systems design. I think that's what Yosef was talking about. He was basically positioning New Zealand as an incubator for systems design, uh, which is very seductive and very difficult because trying new systems means you're automatically doing things that the rest of the world doesn't want to or need to do.

So it's risky. Uh, but I can throw some things out that I think are provocative. Yeah. And interesting. Uh, let me just touch on two. One is digital literacy and the other is immigration. Um, you know, in terms of digital literacy, I think that, uh, computers are the most powerful tool ever created by humanity.

Um, they've they allow for infinite level. Without permission. And, uh, to me that, uh, knowing how to be good with computers is the modern literacy. It's like the new reading, writing, arithmetic, and this will be widely accepted and acknowledged decades from now. But today we're in that transition phase where as a software engineer, Very well paid and there's no unemployment, but, uh, as someone transitioning out of the old economy, you have this giant gap to jump.

Um, so I think it would be interesting. One system design experiment that would be interesting is to create an entirely digitally literate nation where everybody is facile with computers. And of course not, everyone's going to be a computer related job, but just the fact that you can use this creative tool to its maximum output.

Um, gives you an advantage, a leg up in every possible way. You'll make better podcasts. You'll do better. Uh, you know, you'll be better at creating documents. Be better at coding up your ideas. You'll be better at even just using online banking or your storage. Um, but just like if you understand mathematics fairly well, then you don't fear science books, you can pick up anything the same way.

If everybody understood computers well enough, they didn't fear computers at all. They would be highly leveraged and for innovation and employment, that could be a huge thing. Um, it would also interestingly, raise all the wages across the board and other professions too, because there's a thing in economics called Baumol's cost disease, where the, uh, the, the.

Value that you have to pay someone the opportunity cost of what else they could be doing, uh, not necessarily what they are doing. So even if all the baristas had computer science degrees, they get paid a lot more. Um, so that's an example of something radical and interesting you can do, but I don't think it's that radical.

And people often would say like, well, why do I need it? No, how to code a computer. I don't need to know how to fix my car, to drive my car, but it's different that the car is a utility that gets you from point a to point B and you do the same thing over and over. Whereas a computer is a creative tool in a creative process.

It's not going to be automated away. And every person who uses a computer it's like using a paintbrush or a, or a writing instrument, you're using it for a different thing, uh, for self-expression and a blank canvas of possibilities. Uh, so I think having a fully digitally literate nation and, uh, New Zealand was well positioned to do that by being English speaking country, first-world rule of law, good educational system, um, and a fairly small enough community that you can make that kind of a push I think would be really interesting.

So, and you also said immigration yeah. Is, is interesting because I think people look at Silicon valley and they say, how can we create a Silicon valley here? Um, and that's an experiment that's been tried all over. Um, but really, uh, Silicon valley is not a place that creates entrepreneurs or wealth or technology.

It is a place that attracts entrepreneurs who create wealth and technology. And, uh, and so it's really an attractor function and that's true of almost any magnet place like Hollywood. Attracts the potential actors and artists, uh, into it, doesn't create them. Those are not necessarily all native Los Angelenos, although the natives really benefit from, from that.

Um, so I think that it's, it's about attracting so intelligent immigration policy is actually the largest wealth creator. Uh, and, uh, and it's not done that intelligently in most places, most places it's sort of an accident, a happenstance of history, like, oh, we have, uh, we have, uh, a technology university here.

We have good weather and so on. Um, so I think that if you look at, especially in the, and I'm focused on technology industry, obviously you're for immigration, you can do lots of things. You can say. Attract people who make an impact. I want attract teachers, but whatever you're doing, you can do it intentionally.

And at least in the technology industry, these people, thanks to again, computers are the most leveraged people in the world. So their earning power is very high, so they actually choose to live in the nicest places. So they want to live in places with good weather and clean. Clean air and high quality of life and culture.

And I think in all of those things, New Zealand scores really well. Uh, the timezone is great. The access to the Pacific room is great. Um, so New Zealand to me already has a lot of the elements to, uh, use, uh, immigration policy as a force multiplier. Um, so I think it really just comes down to both attracting and screening, sort of the right people for the limited resources that you have.

Um, and you know, I mean, look at the HF 400 visas, it's gonna make a big difference. 400 is not a lot. Right. You can, you can fit them in one small neighborhood, uh, or one small cluster of houses, but it can in theory, change, change things. And, and on the technology side, I'm curious if you could speak to the trends that you're seeing, some of the significant trends of importance and why they're important, w we're actually kind of in a good phase of, I think technology innovation right now that this there's a good or bad.

I don't, I don't mean to judge, but, uh, we've gone through different phases. Uh, we are creating and discovering and, uh, rolling out new platforms and systems that change things. So for example, mobile phones was a platform. The internet was a platform, uh, personal computers were a platform, uh, that, that changed things quite a bit.

And then we go. Exploitation phases on those platforms where we build lots of apps. So, you know, there was the mobile social phase where we built Facebook and Twitter and so on, but those are interesting apps, but it's kind of a lower level of innovation or equally necessary, but not as paradigm busting.

And I would say now, interestingly, technology is going back into that paradigm busting phase where. Uh, investors, angels entrepreneurs are getting bold enough, uh, and emboldened and, uh, enough to take the risk to do things like, Hey, now we're going to develop supersonic airplanes. We're going to send rockets to Mars.

We're going to send a, you know, we're going to build electric cars. We're going to build autonomous vehicles. We're going to build VR and AR. Um, we're going to get remote working, right. So that it feels like you're actually there. Um, we're going to do synthetic biology and hack humans, which is both scary and exciting.

Um, scary first exciting later. Fortunately, that's, it's the nature of technology, the destructive power arise before the creative power. Uh, you get to. Have a nuclear weapon before you get to have a functioning, safe nuclear plant, you get to have a, you know, the, you get the, uh, unfortunately in social media you get combat before he gets civil discourse.

Uh, so it's, even if you go back through human history, gunpowder, before you get, uh, steam engines and airplanes. So it's just, unfortunately the nature of technology that the disruptive and that this of power arrives first. So, uh, we're going to get all the dysfunctional dystopian things, you know, maybe VR and AR is like a place for people to rally who couldn't rally in the real world or for a, you know, how the internet famously adopts porn and gambling before almost any other application.

But eventually, uh, you will see the fruits come out of that if we live long enough. And synthetic bio is an, is an interesting one that regard, um, AI today is going through a machine. Uh, machine vision revolution, where, uh, computers are getting very, very good at pattern matching and problem solving of a very specific kind of problem.

Um, but it does mean that, uh, we're going to see very intelligent agents living in the networking cloud and changing how we do things. So I think all of those are really interesting and I, and I give full credit to people like Elon Musk, who just really upped the bar. On what's conceivable, right? Just by doing audacious things or trying audacious things, even if they fail, even if they're not good at it, even if you have problems with the financial shenanigans is just at least the vision, I think, inspires people to move forward.

And he's not the only one, there's a bunch of entrepreneurs now who are kind of just trying to do very audacious things. And on that point, some people say, you know, we want to shift away from this cult of entrepreneurship or this worshiping the entrepreneurs. How do you feel. There's definitely a cult of entrepreneurship in Silicon valley.

There's, there's kind of a hierarchy, which is like all the status derives from the entrepreneur. And then it sort of filters down to the other people in the ecosystem will help make things happen. Uh, and then of course the users and customers and broader society. That they stand upon. I just think it's a nature of humans that you you're always going to have a little bit of hero worship.

You're always going to create a cult. Like you, you go to Hollywood and there's a cult of the celebrity. I mean, there's such a cult that they give each other awards every year and then we tuned into watch it. Uh, so it's, it's just the nature of politicians. We create a cult around the top politicians without looking at all the people that they stand on.

It's just kind of how humans are hard. It's how we get inspired. Um, so I think it's completely fine to use an entrepreneur as a source of inspiration, but I think it's silly to use them as a source of truth. Right? Like, in fact, it's silly that I'm up here and I'm kind of giving you all this so-called truth.

And really, I just have very narrow specialization in a very narrow set of things, but somehow for some reason, somebody. To hear my opinion and everything. Uh, that's the cult of personality kind of poking through, but still you've got to pick some monkey to get in front of the tribe, you know, at various points.

So this might turn right now. And one of those things that you Venice, a specialist that is blockchain. And so I'd love to hear what is blockchain? What is it? Yeah, I got into cryptocurrencies and blockchains back in 2013. And, uh, it was, to me, it first fascinated as technology solution to a very particular computer science problem called the Byzantine General's problem.

But all you need to understand is what they'd solve is a way of getting a bunch of people who don't know each other and don't trust each other to still agree on something. And this is a much harder problem than it may sound like. Um, you know, humans are. Uh, highly cooperating, organizing creatures much more so than almost any other species in the natural domain.

And that allows us to do amazing things. Like we can all get in this room and work together to what we believe is a better future. It also allows us to do terrible things, like get together in a battlefield and kill each other and name some ideology. You know, monkeys don't have Christianity or fascism.

They don't, they don't come up with those ideology. So they don't, they don't murder each other in large quantities. Um, but that ability to unite together. Is both our superpower and our curse because when you get together, how do you operate that network of people? How do we make decisions? And historically, we've had a couple of answers and they all have different trade-offs.

Uh, the old answer used to be the most brutal monkeys in charge that used to be the king. And that's still, how much of the world lives today under dictators? Um, then it was just the same. It's in most violent few monkeys who get together are in charge and that's aristocracies or if it's a smartest, it's the elites, but you have a small number of people, sort of, uh, running things for society.

Uh, religion was another one, you know, I talked to God, God gave me the answers you listened to me. Um, there was another model around a democracy where we're all equal. We all. But you also can end up with mob justice mob rule, where the majority turn turns in the minority. So you just have all these different systems of organizing people.

And in the last few hundred years, we've created a new one called markets. Uh, and these could be markets and, you know, things you like and things you don't, but it's essentially just this idea that we can trade things and sort of self organizes. And there's a merit model. How much money I put in or what assets I put in what I get back, but no, one's really in charge.

If you look at the global credit markets, debt markets, equity markets, money markets, commodity markets, no, one's really in charge. So what blockchains do is they bring the ability to have markets into any digital channels. Um, so you can take any digital network, uh, and there were a lot more digital networks out there than we think.

So for example, Uber is actually a digital network. That's routing cars around, uh, your local public utility is actually a digital network. That's routing power around, especially if we all had solar and we were trading that power. Um, today we have cell phone carriers that are top down, but actually each of our phones, it's broadcasting, Bluetooth, and wifi, and you could stay and we have wifi access points at home.

You could stitch together a digital network. And a blockchain based network isn't owned by anybody. It isn't run by anybody. It's sort of, I think we're sort of a temporary blip in history where all of your connections with your friends are controlled by one small set of people out of Palo Alto, uh, or all the digital news media.

And the world is run basically by Twitter and YouTube. And it's a very small number of people. So it is the nature of the current generation of technology that it is a highly centralized. We have replaced geographic oligopolies with global monopolies. Um, while at the same time, there's sort of this long tail of independent actors, but that fat middle that used to exist in the old world is gone.

When you would have 10 e-commerce retailers. And now you just have one that's kind of controlling the whole internet retail, uh, when you would have had hundreds of local. Taxi deaths, dispatchers, but now all taxes are dispatched out of San Francisco by Uber or Lyft. Uh, so that trend line is very worrying because that's not the internet.

I think we were all promised. We were promised at decentralized internet where we kind of all collectively control outcomes, but like in any system you have to have rules. You have to have consensus. You have to have ways of rewarding people who contribute to the network. You have to, we have ways of punishing cheaters who harm the network.

And, and blockchains use mathematics, cryptography, peer to peer networking to create digital consensus and allow truly leaderless digital networks. And I think that is what is compelling about them. And we're starting with the financial applications because money is a ledger. It's something that we've been historically had to put a king in charge for, or, or a state.

And they have a habit, you know, when you hand somebody the ability to print money, then they just print more of it. And so we would find this way into their pockets and their, and their friend's pockets. Um, and, and maybe not a problem, New Zealand, because it's a famously uncorrupt country, but, uh, yeah, even there, right.

There's always something. Um, but, uh, Compared to other parts of the world that are outright kleptocracy is, uh, that can be problematic. So you have things like Bitcoin that, uh, essentially separate money from India, from any individual controlling the money. And then it becomes collective money. Uh, if theory tries to do that for a programmable financial system, and I think you'll see.

Blockchains get good at tackling those problems. And they demonstrate that they can secure something as hard to secure as the ability to make an issue and transfer money. Then they can be trusted in all other aspects of life. So I think it's really interesting and people say, well, well, you know, the cryptocurrency market's down 90% plus in the last year, isn't it over?

Or. Was it a fad or how do you respond? Yeah, I mean, look, it's a, it's a highly speculative market. It's, it's this weird combination of money and code and governance. Um, and, uh, you know, dot com went through this in 1999, 2000. So I've seen this kind of movie before and crypto is a really hard problem.

Crypto is you're basically saying. I'm going to create digital gold. I'm going to make it unhackable, even though the reward will be hundreds of billions of dollars. Trust me, I don't have a bug in this code because if I do you lose all your money. Um, it's very hard to secure and transfer. Uh, it's still very, very much in development.

It feels like the computers were in the 1980s. Uh, not where the internet was in 1990s, but it's moving faster. So there's still a lot of fundamental development work to be done. Uh, crypto is not simple. Computer science. It is bleeding edge, computer science, game theory, uh, attack vectors hacking. You're trying to solve some very hard problems.

So it's going to take time to figure it out. And, uh, today for example, the total stock of Bitcoin in the world is validated about $80 billion and or $70 billion. If you take into account losses. And so on the, um, the, the actually started higher, it would be about a hundred, but the total gold supply in the world is somewhere around seven or $10 trillion.

And Bitcoin does a lot of the things that gold does, uh, some better, some worse, um, better in the center. Digitally transmissible, easier to secure more scarce, uh, worse in the sense that there might be a bug, uh, you can get hacked, um, uh, you might lose your password Passkey, which I've seen happen to friends of mine.

Um, so it's, it's. Much less, certain as much more new Gold's been around forever. So what you have right now is the market is pricing Bitcoin as being somewhere between one 500th, the chance of being digital goal to one, 1000 2, 1, 100. And when the market changes mind and these very little probabilities, you have these massive swings in the price.

Um, so it does end up being a very speculative instrument today. Uh, and it's like an angel investment or like an early venture investment where you can lose all your money or. Um, but, uh, and, and there's a lot of risk involved, but there's also a lot of reward it. These are not ready for prime time yet, but they'll get there going to go deeper onto blockchain, crypto theory.

And the like, I do want to, just while we have everyone talk a little bit, you're famous on Twitter now, where did this come from? You know, and, uh, if you could talk a little bit about your becoming famous in terms of talking about the inner game of entrepre, Yeah. So fame is a curse. I don't recommend it for anybody.

Uh, you want to be, you want to, uh, you know, this is glow, but you want to be rich and anonymous, not poor and famous. Uh, cause like this is the disease of social media. Everybody is getting their five seconds of fame and becoming a celebrity and celebrities are the most miserable people in the world. So it's not necessarily a good thing to go for.

Uh, that said, you know, I think what happened was like anyone who's been an entrepreneur. Yeah. Uh, I was running extremely high stress lifestyle. And one of the things that makes entrepreneurship especially stressful is that not only are you supposed to, uh, have all the answers, uh, you know, you're doing very hard work, but you're supposed to never show weakness, uh, because your board members, you show them weakness.

You know, they're, they're not going to fund you. They're not going to trust you. Um, you show it to your employees. They're going to run for the Hills. Your customers are not going to buy for your partners, a partner with you. So you have to show extreme stability. And it's the nature of the technology business that 99 out of a hundred startups effectively fail, um, cause the winners are so outsized and so rare.

So most entrepreneurs walking around know that they don't have product market fit, live in mortal terror of it. They're not allowed to talk about it and everyone has to pretend they're winning and crushing it all the time. Uh, and, and this is highly stressful. Um, So, uh, it, it, most people, I think just melt down or the stress and they just hide it there because we're not taught the modern coping tools, uh, on how to work with it.

And maybe ancient cultures had better answers. You know, you meditate, you walk in nature. Um, you have closer family ties, you have bigger tribes, um, or you're just much less likely to go from. Fresh out of school to lending into running a a hundred person company. So these are just very modern pressures and stresses, uh, and just like anybody, I had to kind of work through it.

And as I worked through it, I started using Twitter as my open diary on what I had learned that was useful to me. Uh, and I think if anybody else was talking about this, it wouldn't be that interesting, but because, uh, you know, I'm in the tech business and supposedly successful and I'm talking about it, I think that gives people license to talk about it.

Um, so I just decided. Five or six years ago that I was done being miserable and I was going to be happy. Uh, you know, and, uh, I know this sounds easy in hindsight, but it was sort of like, well, this entire time, I've just assumed that, uh, happy people aren't successful and if I'm going to be successful, then I can't be happy.

I have to be miserable. If I'm going to make a difference in the world, I have to be unhappy along the way. And I just sort of shifted my mind. And decided actually I'm at a time it's now or never there's no future to live for. And if I don't figure out how to be happy, I'm going to die unhappy. Uh, and it's going to, and I made it a discipline, like, and just like diet and nutrition and exercise.

Uh, these are highly personal disciplines that are unique to each of us. And we have to find what works for us. And Nope, nobody else can give, you can make your diet work for you. Cause it's, it's a battle. That's. Every day, you know, at every meal and no one can make your, uh, exercise and fitness routine work for you.

Cause it's not even just the half hour. You go to the gym or workout. It's a little bit how you carry yourself, how you move, uh, what activities you volunteer for. Um, so the same way, I think your own internal mental state is just as malleable, but just as hard and just as individual. And so I just started documenting my journey and a lot of people actually thought it was straight.

And I did lose some business contacts. It definitely is some business overwritten. Some people were attracted to it, but I don't. But part of being happy is not caring, what other people think. And so I don't care anymore. So there we go, much deeper on this part too. Uh, we're back up here on the main stage at two 30.

Uh, so hope to see you there and we'll open the space for Q and a as well. Uh, please join me in thanking the vault Robuchon. Thanks for sitting through this.
