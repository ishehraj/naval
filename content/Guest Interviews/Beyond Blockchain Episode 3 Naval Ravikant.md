Frankly, there's so much innovation going on. Now, the smartest engineers that I know in software are all kind of gravitationally attracted to crypto, but I think crypto before it's all said and done is going to turn out to have been probably the biggest thing since the original internet. And since the iPhone,

as a fixture of Silicon valley, the  has done it. Whether it's co-founding and building the world's first consumer review site, being an angel investor for billion dollar companies or blogging about personal experiences and philosophies to give back to the community. Neval seems to be at the center of everything.

Most notably he's also the chairman and co-founder of angel list, a company that's been helping entrepreneurs raise funds and source talent since 2000. We were doing angel lists. We're introducing entrepreneurs to investors. We weren't making any money for it, but it turns out that under the old laws and the books that that was only quasi illegal, uh, it's called unlicensed broker dealing.

We sort of went to DC and we said, Hey, look, people are just raising money differently. These days, startups are standing up there and telling everybody what they're doing. And it's not only accredited investors with whom they have preexisting relationships. There are very sophisticated individuals who aren't milling.

Who wants to be able to invest in startups? All of this has to be fixed. And we got the only bipartisan bill passed in that administration with president Obama. So all of that seemed at the time, very relevant and good. Now, fast forward to the blockchain revolution. ICO's ICO's would not be possible without them.

People don't realize that there are multiple provisions of the jobs act without which the ICO's would have been completely illegal and shut down and day one. The simplest one is general solicitation. You were not allowed to basically tell the world embracing money. You would get shut down just for that.

While many credit involves work on the jobs act as revolutionary for startup funding and the unit. It took a lot longer to realize that it was also a precursor to an even larger trend in global funding. Funnily enough, the same ICO's that the jobs act help enable offered of all another business opportunity.

Years later, uh, late 2014, I helped some friends start Metta stable capital, which is the first crypto fund in the space that, uh, that did, uh, alt coins. Um, because we had a thesis that they're going to be more interesting things than just Bitcoin. Um, and then in 20 16, 20 17 develop more involved in Mehta.

Stable did a whole bunch of, uh, early stage crypto investments. Um, really looking for, uh, coins and blockchains that will. Solve problems that Bitcoin had not yet solved, um, mostly around Turing completeness, programmability, scalability, um, the privacy and so on. So I remember in 2017, um, you said on Laura Shin's podcast that you often liked to invest in money or money, like tokens, has your investment thesis changed in a year?

Uh, well, the investment thesis, just to clarify, it was basically saying that I want to invest in layer one block. Things that have a chance of either being a unit of account or a store of value or a medium of exchange, because that's where the majority of the value will probably accumulate in the short to medium term.

Blockchains are also still facing fundamental problems around scalability and decentralization. So we just haven't solved some very fundamental problems with blockchain. So I was mostly interested investing in high quality academic teams, uh, that weren't like new to the game they'd been in crypto for awhile.

Uh, and we're looking at. Now there's another category, which is sort of dApps. These are a little trickier. We have not yet seen mass market adoption of dApps because the underlying infrastructure is still too clunky. It doesn't scale. Crypto kitties went out, there was a lot of fanfare, but then the underlying Ethereum blockchain, wasn't able to keep up with the demand, but it may be early for depths.

On the other hand, there are some dabs you could argue are very interesting, like an auger or a maker or so on. I'm broadening the horizons slowly, but I still think that we're solving the layer one point. Right now. So that's still kind of where most of my attention is. And so even with the blockchain industry far from perfect novel continues to invest in different projects in the space, whether they're coins and tokens, that aim to capture value as currencies in the near future or decentralized applications with longer time horizons Neval is committed to the industry because of his belief in the technology's potential to secure a better future.

I look forward to the day, uh, for my kids, probably when they can roll out of bed, there's a message on their phone, uh, or in their VR headset that says here's a job. Here's a bunch of jobs for you. Given what you like to do and given your skill sets and your past work, they choose whichever one they want.

Um, they're paid in crypto. Uh, and they work when they want, so it's a gig economy. There's a lot of parallels to decentralized technology and having decentralized technology compliment the vision of the future that you actually yeah. Cause in that world, I don't want to be working for a corporation, uh, nor do I want the central entity.

That's coordinating my work to be taking a 30% app store like cut, like apple would take, my privacy has to be protected in terms of which jobs I did and what I did. Um, my reputation and identity. Still have to be solid, but pseudonymous if I want them to be. So I think that there's a magic combination of blockchain plus VR slash AR you know, that you can kind of squint and sort of make out 20 years out.

Um, that really creates a sovereign individual sort of economy, the whole nine to five drudgery and grind. Uh, that's a product of the industrial age, but that's a product of factories. Uh, and now I think we'll, we'll revert more to a hundred, a hundred gathering kind of time element. Uh, and how we spend our days, but of course we'll be hunting and gathering virtually and digitally.

So that was another episode of block streets beyond blockchain. I had a great time picking devil's brain. We are going to be showcasing a lot of cool figures in the blockchain space.
