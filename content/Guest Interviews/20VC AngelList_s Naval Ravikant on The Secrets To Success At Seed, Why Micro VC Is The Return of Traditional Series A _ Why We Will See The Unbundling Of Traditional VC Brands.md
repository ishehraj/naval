But enough for me. So without further ado, I'm delighted to welcome Navara Advocamp founder and CEO angel list.

You have now arrived at your destination novel. It's such a pleasure to have you on the show. You stay a huge thanks to Rick Mariney for the intro, but I really appreciate you taking the time out to join me. Stay. I'm excited to be here. Thank you very much for having me now. I'd love to get started by discussing a bit about you and how you came to found angel list and what the aha moment was.

Uh, angel list came as an offshoot from venture hacks, uh, venture hacks as a blog that I was co-authoring with. Uh, Angeles, founder, Bubba Navy. And we were basically laying out the game theory of venture capital. In other words, like how to negotiate a term sheet and we, uh, exhaustedly blogged all of that.

And then people said, stop telling me how to negotiate a term sheet. Tell me how to get a term sheet. The same time I was out casually investing through a small fund that I'd raised and the prevailing sentiment at the time. If you find a hot deal, you hold onto it and you move on it before it becomes competitive.

And it seemed odd to me that in day and age of it free information and the internet that you could still make a living by essentially arbitraging information. And that just didn't seem right to me. So maybe, and I basically decided to. Venture hacks and use that as a launching platform and basically start distributing deal flow for free to all of our high quality investor friends.

And there was no grand plan or business model in mind, it was more of a community service. And that's how Angeles was born. Do you have to ask, because Greg sands and I from Costa to, we're both love to hear about the takeaways you had from that experience with the micro VC pool of capital that you had and how that affects how you think and operate today with angel.

Well back at the turn of the millennium, I actually spent a little bit of time in a larger VC firm also. So I was familiar with kind of both sides of it. And what micro VC really is, is to me, it's the return of series, a investing real series, a investing as practiced by Sandhill road disappeared a little while back, essentially the, the, the driver of all, this is the cost of starting a company has come down drastically.

The cost of building a company has come down drastically, at least in the early stages. Uh, but at the same rate, it's much more competitive. There's a lot more competitors out there. So companies don't need $5 million check and lots of diligence to get started. They need a few hundred thousand dollars or perhaps a million to a million and a half dollars to prove to build the initial product and prove out the hypothesis.

And the Sandhill road, investors stopped doing this. And even though they call them. As being in the series eight business, there really aren't probably a series B or the series C. So there was an opportunity for seed investors to show up and to write small checks, but not too much hassle and give the company a chance to build this initial product, then get us initial customers or program and raise money.

And it's an arbitrage opportunity. And that that's. You know, there's a lot of, uh, Greenfield or these was, uh, back when I was doing micro VC, fundamentally in micro VC, it's, uh, finds a one to two people. Uh, you move much more quickly. You're not trying to buy control. You're not taking a board seat. You're not trying to negotiate stiff terms, although evaluation and pricing matter.

And you're really just backing or the entrepreneurs and giving the chance to build their initial products. And you're running much larger portfolios and you're probably spread a center and you're looking for a few breakouts in the portfolio. I mean, I'm, I'm intrigued. I had Charlie O'Donnell from Brooklyn bridge ventures on the show recently, and he said the most seed funds on actually seed funds and then their series a funds with a small allocation of capital for the seed financing to give them the optionalities do follow on funding.

Would you agree with that assessment? Uh, I think like one of those new things you can define it, however, which way you want. Uh, I do think there are plenty of actual seed funds out there that are taking seed level of risk. They may not be the better known ones. A lot of it is determined by sides. The moment of finding managing more than 10 or $20 million in capital, it's unlikely that it's purely in the seed business.

It certainly is bleeding, bleeding into the series a business, but I don't think that this is an opportunity to necessarily point fingers or call names or say my model is better than your model. It's sort of just a way of saying that. Look, there's always going to be a need for people to go to the bright spots.

Yeah. Before a lot of the risks has been removed and traditionally it used to be done by angel investors, but now the market has gotten too big. So when those angel investors get backed up by additional capital, whether it's through syndicates or seed funds or what have you, they're going to play in this market, the need for that is just increasing and increasing.

I don't see that category getting stuck. I'm intrigued. You said that about the angel element and Parker Thompson at angel list with you. So as you're the best person for internalizing the power law, math and behaving rationally with that in mind, he also, how do you look to pick a seed at such early stage?

Yeah, I think it's extremely difficult to, you're not predicting what the winners there's going to be. There's so many of nonlinearities that try to predict a winner at such an early stage and almost, or task. What you're rather doing is eliminating the things that you don't want to invest. The things that would cause you to lose your money.

Uh, some of those factors are economic. So for example, some entrepreneurs have gotten very good at reading uncapped notes. But you can make money on that. You also have to keep evaluations and check. Uh, some of those factors are sector based. You might decide that a certain sectors already over, or, you know, no longer fit for an investment.

Like for example, some people decided a while back that social media was done. Some people decided that when my space was dominant, some people decide that when Facebook was dominant, now people will decide that when Snapchat a dominant, uh, so your timing is it could be off there. You'd have to basically have a broad enough portfolio that you can.

A breakout hit. And if you have a breakout hit, you need a pro-rata rights. So I actually think of the whole seed investing category early on is not so much as picking winners as eliminating losers and assembling a portfolio of good founders. Good projects, good spaces with potential breakout opportunities.

If one of them works the real money, a seed portfolio usually falls right along a power law distribution, where your number one winner will return as much as two through the rest of them. Number two. Whatever put together. Number two would probably be worth number three through whatever put together and so on.

Um, so I actually think it's important to have a lot of shots on goal to have a fairly broad portfolio. So you can catch one or more of these so-called unicorns in my hip forage, which was the name of my little fund that I ran for awhile. I did a lot of investments. I probably did about 120 investments, but in that group, you know, At least three, maybe five so-called unicorns.

It doesn't matter how much you lose because you can only lose one X. It matters how much you went and when you win, then of course, ownership and valuation, all those things come into play. But the most important thing is to be so a question from Dave Mclear funnily enough. Very similar to that broad portfolio approach.

Do you very much advocate for the much broader, wider portfolio of catching the unicorn? Or do you prefer the doubling down in the successful companies and placing much larger bets? I think that's a debate that you can have all day long. I think it's more important that it lines up with how you do your own investing, what your best style is and where your area of expertise.

Uh, that said, I think naturally going to gravitate towards later stage because for one thing to write larger budget checks and one more ownership, uh, and secondly, you're going to spend a lot more time diligence of the company. So there has to be something there to diligence. Uh, it's very unlikely that someone who's only making 10 or 20 investments or the course of their fund is going to invest at all in tiny little startup teams.

Need a half, a million dollars each and have shown nothing today. Those kinds of investments, those very, very early investments are going to be the bulk of a seed portfolio that may be spread across a 50 or a hundred beds. So I think basically you go wherever your style is and the style and the amount of capital that you have will dictate what stage you're at.

So I don't think it's an either or the industry absolutely needs both. If you look at the, probably the single most successful venture investor in the planet right now is Y Combinator and they have an incredibly broad, broad portfolio, thousands upon thousands of companies. They're very, very early. They get a very low valuation and they're willing to invest when nobody else is.

Okay. Absolutely talking about kind of the picking element there. Uh, one of the many factors for some can be valuation, uh, as we've discussed, uh, Jonathan Abraham's and nozzle, uh, ask, what is your opinion on the bundling of counsel and advice in how you think valuation is temporary and control is forever.

Yeah, these are, uh, catchphrases that we can with our venture hacks over the years. But one of those is that venture is a bundle of advice, control, and money and good entrepreneurs, unbundled those things and kind of purchase what they needed market rates. Sometimes you'll, especially in the later stages where the quality of the investor matters less because they don't have control.

You go for the best source of capital possible, the cheapest source of capital. So for example, like an Uber doesn't care about. Board value add, they care about how much capital they're getting at what valuation and the earlier stages. You may kind of care more about advice, but you may choose to unbundle that you may choose to raise money for them, but I have a different one on your board.

Although very often did this. Okay. And then control is something that at the seed level that nobody wants to give away. And in fact, the smart investors, you don't even want to buy it either because they don't want that level of oversight over tiny company. So I think venture used to be this bundle of advice, control and money, but increasingly the market is unfunded.

Now the control element is the most tricky one. The prevailing wisdom has always been raise money from these five or 10 grade farms, because we know that they're going to be good to you when they have control, set aside, whether that's true or not. It's actually highly depends on the circumstances. The problem is that sometimes people give up control for high value.

But whoever has control eventually gets the valuation that they want, because they'll be able to force you to situations game, theoretically, speaking, where they can dictate the terms. So I would rather take a low valuation and keep control in terms of board control and control a protective provisions rather than vice versa, maximize the valuation, but give up.

And I think you see that of a lot of the unicorns where especially if they're struggling to raise late-stage capital, they have to give up all kinds of control provisions in exchange for getting a high sticker evaluation, but really underneath the dilution that they're either facing now or will face later at an liquidity event is much greater than the headline valuation would apply.

And you cannot divorce an investor. It's not even like that. There was no possibility of divorce. So once you've given an investor control, that's it. I, I do have to also obviously the investors with the big Abrons and in some cases can be more stringent on ownership controls, and can have the leverage to force those through and negotiate those better because of that brands.

And I listened to you with Tim. And you stated about kind of the possibility of a journalist building a brand and building a unique portfolio of work through that brand over the next 20 years. How important do you think investor brand is? We've seen the rise of the likes of Tim Ferriss, et cetera, building that brand.

What's your take on the rise of these VC or investor brands and how important they are. Pardon? Because at the end of the day, venture capitalists are sending money and money. Then the ultimate commodity, you know, money is money. As long as the federal reserve signature is on there, it's a federal reserve note.

It doesn't matter who it comes from. Uh, and gentlemen, if you look in sales, the better paid the sales person, the more of a commodity they're selling. So for example, uh, people who are selling real estate or a million dollar contracts, you know, into enterprise software, those sales people get paid a lot more.

I'm going to pay you a commission to sell apple products. That's not a commodity. Well, it's so unique and branded within the product. So you don't need a sales person to sell them and you would pay that salesperson, a tiny commission. So VCs get paid really well because they're selling a commodity at its core.

That commodity is money. So they have to add on advice and brand. And those advice and brand become really important. So because every one of the VC business, so, and commodity, ironically brand ends up being really simple. But what I would already use, the kind of brand that is losing value is the firm brand.

So just because you're at spruce capital and spruce capital has been around like a rock for 50 years, doesn't mean as much anymore. What matters is who is the individual? What have they done? What do entrepreneurs think of them? How can they add value? How do they behave in difficult situations? What infrastructure does Bruce capital have for its portfolio companies?

Does it have recruiting services? Does it have great CEO? Et cetera. So I think that the idea of a brand, just because the recognizable name is diminishing in value and instead the brands are being driven much more concretely, much more transparently based on what you do. And as part of that, what's happening is that brands are unbundling they're unbundling from the firm level to the individual level.

My journalist's analogy is that in the old days, if you want to. You had to go work for the New York times, the Washington post and use their brand. But today you can actually start a great blog, do some original research. You can get on Twitter, you can get a Snapchat and you can create your own media channels and build your independent brand.

You can even see this in politics or Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump rose up with brands that were actually larger than the Democrat or the Republican party, in some sense, or outside of it, the party brands are getting unbundled. So in an age of direct media brands become unbundled and become much more about the individual.

And much less about the network or the firm. Absolutely. And when the brands do essentially pay off, though, and they do generate the returns, I do want to move into an element though. Park told me you had some contrarian views on, on social organization and policies. So I'm intrigued. How do you see the technology itself?

The techies you've generated the wealth affecting how we live over the next say, 50 years. And, um, which do you think will be more impactful? Or the money that's generated, definitely the technology. I think the history of the human race, this is actually the history of technology. So if you go back to, uh, you know, what we really are, we're basically chattering monkeys and you and I should be sitting in the woods right now, trying to figure out how to start a fire and how to get shelter and how to get food.

But the only thing that allows us to be talking to these wonderful devices and wearing clothes and living in comfort is technology and society follows technology. What happens is technology creates abundance or wealth in certain areas, but that wealth has to be. Protected and spread and created, and the structure of society sort of falls out of that.

So I think technology changes society. It works. We'd like to think that the technology is a subset of society. I would argue that it is the fundamental thing that differentiates the human species from every other animal and puts us at the top of the food chain. So I think the repercussions of technology are almost unimaginable and it's, it's sort of a fool's errand to try, but I can try, uh, I mean, to give you an example, I think drones are going to replace every second.

The weapons system on the planet. They're going to replace everything from aircraft carriers to, to airplanes, to infantry soldiers. Once drones get small enough and effective enough, uh, no other form of character Realty, survivor compete on the button on the battlefield. It's similar. You're going to see with Uber and self-driving cars, they're going to, they're going to reshape the way that we set up our cities.

Uh, do we need parking lots anymore? How many cars do we need per person? Do we need to devote the centrality of our cities to roads? So that's an example. If you look at how Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are going to play out, there'll be. Do away with a lot of the extraneous financial infrastructure that we have.

Do we need bankers sitting in wall street and high-rises, but do we need lawyers, negotiating smart contracts? And they can actually be written directly in the blockchain. I think the nature of society itself is going to change. You know, you see people talk about. Income about structural unemployment about the gig economy, what the optimal size of the firm.

These are very, very fundamental things. You know, where do you live distributed companies and you're in London right now. I'm in, I'm in Silicon valley. We're having this conversation. Do we need to live in Silicon valley? So I think, I think technology. Ultimate driver. And if you understand where technology is headed, you can see where society is headed.

You see this in good science fiction, by the way, good science fiction ends up utopian or dystopian, but it shows how society has changed fundamentally because of some technological breakthrough. Usually not the other way. It's not like we're gonna have a social breakthrough that will then be to a technological change elements of automation there and universal basic income.

Are there any elements of such a swift transition in terms of adoption rate that it's probably never seen before in terms of technological adoption that concern you with the likes of awesome automation and autonomous cars replacing 4 million trucks driver. What elements concern you? I mean, I think there'll be a lot of, it will be tumultuous, but it doesn't concern me.

I mean, fundamentally I am a scientist by training. I love technology and I think it's, uh, it's good for the human species overall, probably the, you know, the one part that's disconcerting is that technology doesn't make it easy to destroy. So the destructive power of a single human being continues to go up throughout human history, you know, starting with an individual with his fist, can't do too much damage.

Individually with a knife can do more damage. Individual gun can do a lot more damage. Eventually in, along the timeline, someone can 3d print a nuclear weapon, right? So what does it stop? So our level of consciousness that sophistication, you know, we almost have to start thinking of humanity as a multicellular organism, as opposed to a collection of unison.

Organisms cause like I don't destroy my own body, even though at some point, my body used to consist of lots of separate creatures. And even though they compete internally at some level, maybe there are bacteria inside of me that are competing with each other. But mainly like if you look at the mitochondria, they actually have a, they have, there's a hypothesis that mitochondria used to be separate creatures and other inside ourselves.

And we were highly symbiotic relationship. Survive. I think humans have to start thinking of themselves the same way. And I think that's a natural outgrowth of the internet and globalization that we're just intimately all connected, but that connection has to happen faster than the destruction destructive power of any single individual increases.

And so that's the, that's the old fast tune myth. That's the fast tune bargain with technology, um, and moving from, uh, the district team mitochondria to the natural transition, to the vision that had failed. That's such a swift transition to me. I do want to discuss the vision that had for the angel list platform.

And again, a question from Jonathan Abraham's and nozzle and asking what is the next thing for the angel list platform and how far up the funding chain can angel risk. Yeah. So angel list gets tacked as just purely about funding, but we're doing a lot more than that. That fundraising, especially the seed side of the small market takes a long time to play out.

We've now run about 1200 deals to the Angeles platform, breeds hundreds upon hundreds of millions of dollars for entrepreneurs. But obviously there's still some in the VC community who don't want to admit that it's real, uh, or here to last. So we have to show the returns for investors. Then we have to show that.

Good companies coming out of it. And then it'll sort of take a natural attack towards raising more capital and doing more later stage rounds. In the meantime, we also operated the single largest site for recruiting for tech companies and startups in the world. And our Angeles talent platform has on the order of 25,000 companies and a million candidates using it.

So it's very, very, very popular, the most popular of its kind. So I think. To be done there. And then we recently acquired product hunt, which is the number one place where companies go to launch their products online. So really what we're doing this year is putting all the pieces together. So we're the best place to raise the money, to hire talent and to launch your product.

Then on the flip side, where the best place to invest money in startups and to find a job at a startup and to of course, find great new products that you should try out again. So the combination of that, I think creates a powerful technology network, sort of like LinkedIn, but much more based on usage and not just a big connection pile of resumes.

And so th that's kind of the vision for this year beyond that. I can't tell you, I don't, I don't believe in five-year plans. Grand massive strategic missions, because I think the world has changed as too quickly. Absolutely. The full stack of angel list. I do want to move into a quick fire round there. So I say a short statement, and then you give me your immediate thoughts about 60 seconds per one.

How does that sound? So let's start with, and I'm interested for this one, your favorite book and why, and then how do you decide what to read? Yeah, I don't have a single favorite book cause that reads so much and anytime anyone smart recommends anything interesting, I buy it or download it instantly and I usually have flipped through and discard it unless it really speaks to me.

So my favorite book of the last few years is sapiens that you all know of. Harvey's history book. Uh, previous few years was the rational optimist Matt Ridley's book. Uh, but it changes a lot. Poor Charlie's Almanack by Charlie Munger is another one that I would throw in there. What would you most like to see change in the world of VC?

I don't know how realistic this is, but I would love to see VC venture capitalists behave a lot more. Like entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs are very transparent with their product and pricing and what you get. I love to see venture capitalist, provide the SLA a service level agreement with their principles.

Directly online concretely, talk about control versus not control what valuations that they offer, et cetera, et cetera. I'd like them to sell and price their product very much as an enterprise software product is if I go to the homepage of a startup company and they're selling a product, I can usually very quickly find out what exactly is the product?

How is it differentiated? Who's a good for how much did they charge? And, you know, what's the money back guarantee or policy by. Uh, on a venture capitalist fee page, all I find it's feel good text. I don't find anything concrete. And what are the most common misconceptions you find about angel? S probably the most common is people think it's a crowdfunding platform.

It's not, we only deal with sophisticated accredited investors. Although you can do crowdfunding through an offshoot that we have called Republic. Another common misconception is people think that, you know, you can just take any idea posted up there and then how come I'm not getting funded? The reality is it's still hard.

We've made it easier. People to get you money online, but it's still not like instant or trivia. It's not like Kickstarter. So it's still a more complicated, sophisticated thing. And then I think the final one is Bush came out a little bit in some of your questions is that Angeles is mainly about fundraising, but the reality is that our talent platform is probably the biggest piece of what we do today.

And then in terms of blogs or newsletters, are there any mustards when they're released or in your inbox? I generally flipped all over the place, but I always make time to read Kevin similars, melting asphalt blog. It really makes me think on many, many levels Farnam street by Shane Parrish, uh, always helps make me more thoughtful and more rational of an individual for Ben Thompson street strategically.

That's probably the only newsletter that I pay for it. And I get huge value out of, I think those three are standout. Um, mostly I get my reading though from Twitter, I follow some really interesting, intelligent people. And then what drives you personally? I get this one a lot. And what's the core driver behind all that you really do?

It's a very hard question in 60 seconds. It should be about making money at the intersection of science and technology, but I like science. I like technology and I feel like it fundamentally moves the ball forward. And so making money at it was a goal for awhile these days. I think it's much more about.

I think the end learning, meaning finding actual truth, not social truth. I think a lot of the truths that we're taught in life for, in schools or friends, or just social trips that feel good for crowds, but not necessarily the correct answer. So I'm looking to learn as much as I can. I love the aha moment when two different concepts connect together in your head in a new way, and you, and you see something in a way that you cannot unsee.

Um, so I'm mainly about learning truth in the aha moment. I would say that's the main driver, uh, at least intellect. And then what's the most recent investment that you've made publicly announced. That is. And why you said yes. Yeah, I make a lot of investments, so I won't fixate on any one small investment.

And I think what's more interesting is it's a class of investment that I've gotten into recently in the last few years that I think most venture capitalists are either missing or cannot participate in. And that's the cryptocurrency investments, things like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Z cash. Et cetera. I think a lot of the protocol level innovation is moving away from venture backed startups and moving into blockchain based protocols.

So also there's file coin and Blockstack and others there. And that category, a lot of VC firms can invest in because if the buy the coin, they're not structured to do that, but what's interesting to truly democratize. And so anyone in the world can invest in those people. A lot of future returns and innovation technology are moving into that class of investments.

So I think that class in investments is really interesting. Thank you so much, giving up the time to say, to be on the show.
