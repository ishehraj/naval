![[y2mate.com - Token Summit II  Cryptocurrency Money and the Future with Naval Ravikant.mp3]]

So to start off, uh, by show of hands, how many people follow Naval on Twitter? I'm curious. Okay. So, oh, can we get the mic on? Hello, there we go. I was about to delete my account, but I guess I'll hold off. And so, uh, I think this is like a hardcore crypto audience, so we're not gonna, uh, ask too many kind of surface level questions and try to kind of dive deep on crypto stuff.

But I guess the first question I have is, uh, how much time are you spending on crypto related stuff versus non crypto related stuff? Uh, mind share or physical toaster? Yes. I think my insurer, when like most people, when you first figure out what crypto really means, uh, it's sort of an infinite rabbit hole.

You can spend a lot of time on it. So I would say mine share is probably about, uh, you know, 60 to 80%. Uh, but obviously I'm still involved very much in classic tech investing investments. I've made angel list. And so. Got it. So there's been a lot of craziness this year, right? I think even kind of the biggest bull in the room's probably surprised with how quickly things have been.

Um, what surprised you most about, uh, kind of crypto in 2017? Well, I think everyone's been surprised by the price appreciation, uh, the actual technical innovation in this space. You know, there's been quite a bit of that, but it certainly hasn't been the 15 X, 20 X at the prices. So to some extent the market is catching up and possibly even exceeding the current realization of the technology.

Um, it's seems to be going mainstream mainstream in the magazine covers sense faster than I would have expected. Like there are now endowments and larger institutions that are seriously looking at it. There are people solving a lot of the financing, custody problems. Uh, it's probably fallen a little short on the tech development.

I think we're still facing some very fundamental technical issues and scaling blockchains. Uh, we haven't seen a lot of. Uh, high quality applications out of purely financial and speculative ones. Um, and so to see the, the money use case, the store of value use case, the story around, uh, digital gold or replacing financial assets get so far so quickly, uh, I think that's been a shock to everybody, um, in a sense it's good news.

You know, it's the nature of these things that you, when you have new technology, you need to have something that resembles. A froth or a bubble or hype to sort of bring in the capital and bring in entrepreneurs who are then going to deploy actual, uh, brain power against it. But it may take five or 10 years before many of these problems get solved.

So, um, that, that disconnect, I think, is surprising to anybody who's paying attention. So sorry to give the same answer that I think everybody in the crowd would give, but I think that's the right. Are there any particular kind of catalysts in the past year or so that you think, uh, have, has made the crypto story more relatable to people, whether it's the 2016 presidential election or.

Yeah. Anything like that? Yeah, there's a, there's the old mark Twain line. Like there's nothing. So, uh, damaging to one's sense of self being as watching a friend get rich. So I think that's been happening a lot. A lot of people have been watching their friends get rich, and I think that just sort of creates, uh, a frenzy, uh, and, and pulls people into it.

I don't think the presidential election necessarily has a lot to do with it directly, other than to the extent that we're in a very deregulatory environment. Uh, the current administration. Uh, they put out an executive order in the first a hundred days. And regardless of what you think of them, the, the executive order basically said to, uh, executive branch agencies for every two regulations you introduce are enforced in kind of a new way or interpreted a new way.

You have to. So for each one you have to remove two. Um, so I think that's been very beneficial for crypto. A lot of people are wondering why the sec crack down on ICS has been fairly limited to. Uh, and I think at least crypto is getting its little, uh, uh, period of grace period, sort of like the internet data in the early days where it was relatively regulation free and still is.

Um, but that regulation free grace period is really important for any new technology to develop. And at least in the United States, uh, crypto is getting it worse. If you look in places like China, right? It's like very whiplash. One moment is a free for all. And the next moment, all the exchanges are shut down and people are told they can't trade anymore.

Uh, so I think that that part of it is good. Uh, but frankly what's attracting the general interest is just the opportunity to make money. I don't think most people are thinking about this as, wow, it's the next generation of internet protocols or, Hey, we have a way to achieve consensus among humans that doesn't require central controlling party.

Um, or, Hey, this is a new way. Organize the networks of the future that are more peer to peer based, or here's the way to create digital scarcity and transmit value securely over the internet. All of those are incredibly innovative, very fundamental, both things. Uh, but that's not why most people are in it right now, but that's okay.

I mean, most people aren't into money because they like the theory of capitalism and they're like the free exchange. And they're like how, you know, specialization of labor and all that, that people are into it because it lets them get the things that they want. Um, James Arthur had a great quote where he said, you know, money, won't solve all your problems, but it'll solve all your money problems.

Uh, so I think people are just looking to solve their money problems. And a lot of people have money problems. And you look at crypto, right? Uh, when, when you're, we're in an environment where, uh, savings accounts are returning nothing, treasury bills and bonds are returning nothing. Uh, the federal reserve has been all the central banks of the world have been in the grand money printing experiment, uh, which is basically destroying savers way.

And all the money's rusting into assets and the higher risk the asset, the more it inflates and crypto is a very, very high risk asset that can basically take in unlimited amounts of money because there's no, there's no price to earnings ratio underneath. There's no fundamentals to get disconnected from.

It started disconnected from fundamentals and day one. So as an asset class that can absorb almost infinite speculative money and when the, uh, central banks of the world. Uh, you know, have taken undertaken policies that are trying to take turn the world into a riskier place. Uh, they may end up turning into a giant casino and I think tech stocks and, uh, to a even greater extent, crypto are beneficiaries.

So we're in some type of bubble. No one knows if it's crashing tomorrow or it's going to go continue going straight up, but, and do you have a view on where we are in, in the cycle? Well, there's an old line, which I'm sort of overused. It goes something like money is the bubble that never pops, right? Like if we all agree upon a certain thing to be money and we all collectively buy into that story, it's like, it's a consensus hallucination.

If we all believe it strongly enough, that new thing becomes money. Uh, so in that sense, It could be a bubble that could go on for a long time, or it could go on forever or could certainly inflate beyond any rational, underlying, uh, assessment you may have of it. Um, but every bubble that pops along the way, that's the tulip bubble.

That's the Southeast bubble. So you have to be super careful. Um, so I don't, I don't know where we are in the bubble. I don't even know if it is a bubble and I would be hesitant to. As such, because that implies that it's going to pop. We all know people who have been waiting to buy Bitcoin this year and they're waiting for it to go down in price.

And some people go on Twitter, Twitter, and they're famously rant about how they sold all their Bitcoin. Then they look like fools because a month later it's at three times the price. So this is the kind of asset classwork and run up 10 X and then the pop might be 50%. But given where you were waiting to enter, it's still up five X from.

So you can't time these things. I think one just has to have a very long-term viewpoint on it. Um, it definitely is frothy, but if you look at the history of crypto, I think every two to three years, uh, it's gone up about five to 10 X. So waiting can be very expensive. Uh, on the other hand, if, uh, there, there are still things that could go catastrophically wrong that could drive the whole space to zero.

Um, so if you have more than, you know, one or 2% of your net worth, and it's, you're kind of a fool. Bitcoin, for example, the whole point there is that it's a decentralized store of value. Um, well the decentralization may not turn out not to be true. Um, the mining is heavily centralized. Uh, it's arguable that even today, the majority of the mining operations are controlled by one very small set of it.

Ballistic operators in China who are essentially in the jurisdiction of the Chinese government and may actually be one entity underneath. And even if that problem were to be solved, it may just turn out that the proof of work function underlying Bitcoin inherently forces centralization, because you're basically running data centers to do mining underneath and data center operations are inherently get, get economies of scale and efficiency of scale by being packed closely together.

Uh, clustered. So it may just be that the proof of work system may be inherently centralizing just like the American voting system was supposed to be a democracy and sort of a free for all, but it turned out that it turned into a two party system, uh, because the, the first place winner gets all the results.

It gets all the spoils. So the second and third place parties always have an incentive to combine. Um, so a Bitcoin may end up very much like that, in which case it's not very centralized as a store of value. Um, Bitcoin is also a bet. The initial parameters of the network on how to create decentralized money were roughly correct because, uh, they're not changing, right.

That's become very clear in the recent debates that changes are going to be very, very few and very contentious, uh, and just aren't going to happen because they're concerned about storing value. But if we got the parameters wrong on the first try, or if there's a much better set of parameters, that's not going to happen with Bitcoin.

Um, so I think there's still an enormous amount of risk from here. There, there's still a lot of risks that a given currency goes to zero or close to it. Um, that said, uh, I don't think. Uh, the whole crypto economic revolution is going away. Uh, the idea that we're not going to have a digital consensus networks without trusted third parties in the center who are controlling things.

That idea is too powerful. It's not going away. Uh, thanks to the recent market. There is now an enormous number of very bright people who are going into protocol development instead of app development protocol development now is very, very well-funded. Whereas historically, in the, with the internet protocol development, wasn't funded at all, it was done on the backs of a few volunteers and it was really app development that was funded because the returns went to the apps.

Um, so now there's an opportunity for people to engage in high quality protocol development. And I think we would just. Incredible innovation in protocol development, uh, which is good for those of us who want to see a decentralized internet. I don't think we traded CNN and time Warner and, uh, you know, New York times or, uh, information overlords for Google and Twitter and Facebook as our information overlords that wasn't the deal.

The internet was supposed to be decentralized, supposed to be more of a peer network. Um, so I think we're now starting to, we're now going to. Peer to peer networks, uh, in places that before were unimaginable. Uh, and that's going to create kind of this giant distributed, scalable grid, uh, of the internet, which is I think the real internet that many of us were hoping for.

So I want to talk a little bit about, uh, kind of like investing and you've obviously been a successful angel investor. Um, and you're spending more time on the investing side, looking at new projects. Uh, how do you think about kind of evaluating new projects? And particularly, how does that compare to. You know, five years ago when you were focused only on kind of angel investing to be clear.

I actually don't consider myself qualified to invest in crypto it's way too, technically complicated. Um, so I actually work with partners of mine who are more technically sophisticated, um, and actually read the source code and. And really understand the underlying protocols. So the disclaimer here is my personal investing tends to go through funds like poly chain and Mehta stable, uh, or, uh, you know, I'm looking at the new index fund, that big ways of launching, for example, a disclaimer, I'm an investor there.

Um, So I want to be a little careful. I don't want to give anybody investment advice nor do I want to imply that I actually know something that they don't, because I think the deeper you get into this, the more you realize how fundamentally ignorant most of us are. Um, the set of people who has, who are qualified to invest in the space is probably like less than 1% of the size of all the venture capitalists out there today.

It's a deeply, deeply technical space. It might be like the chip investors. Back when, um, uh, venture investing was starting out in the 1970s or 1980s. So it's a very, very specialized discipline. Um, that said, I think the most interesting use cases these days are mostly in what I would call the money tokens.

Uh, the ones that are either trying to be a store of value. Uh, like Bitcoin or a medium of exchange, uh, you know, like a Z cash or a Monero where they have fungibility and privacy. So they're trying to be used for transactions, uh, or they're trying to be a unit of account, like the stable coins, like base coin and make her die and so on.

I think those are somewhat interesting. Uh, I think the ones that are trying to power financial contracts, um, such as the Ethereum and Tezos, and kind of that whole, uh, chain, uh, our interest. So overall, I think at least in the near term, uh, we're going to see a lot more of the financial and money use cases realized, uh, partially because that's, that's technically an easier use case, like keeping track of a ledger and accounting.

Simpler than trying to figure out how to, uh, power entire new networks for bandwidth or solar power or those kinds of things. I think utility tokens have a little further to go. Um, they're also, uh, just more lucrative, frankly. Like if you can redefine what money is, that's a trillion. Come as opposed to you build a better Airbnb or Uber, and maybe that's a hundred billion dollar outcome.

Um, so those are the ones. So I tend to invest in funds that then tend to go out and look for the money. Tokens is sort of how I would put it. Um, I also do meet with a lot of very early stage companies with brilliant scientists coming out of good universities who are working on these things. And it's intellectually fascinating users to learn so much.

What's possible here. Uh, and, uh, again, the money is pulling people in. It's a signal, you know, when, when prices are high, uh, it is a signal to suppliers to enter the market. So in this case, it's a signal to entrepreneurs to enter the market. Um, and there are brilliant people now who are trying to solve new problems, um, using blockchains, uh, the bad news is that, you know, 95% of it is not problem.

Solve using blockchains. So, uh, 2018, we're probably going to see a lot of VC backed companies that shouldn't be using blockchains who, you know, in 2016 didn't know anything about it. Uh, in 2017 have been busy, really retooling themselves, uh, to be a blockchain based company and 2018. They're going to try and raise money and fall flat on their face because, uh, not everything needs to be decentralized.

Decentralization is very expensive. Uh, it's very inefficient. Uh, you're essentially trading off computational scalability for social scale. Social scalability is only important when you don't want to trust third parties. But a lot of these companies are actually running as a central actor where it's their company, they're making all the decisions, but now they've inserted a decentralized token in the middle, which isn't really decentralized.

It's just horrifically inefficient. Uh, and they're using that because they hope they can raise money. Um, and going back to the bubble thing, I think one indicator that we are in a very frothy and maybe bubbly investment. Is there a lot of tokens that are trading at very high values that are junk, right.

If we had sort of the equivalent of the Amazons and the Googles out there trading at very high valuations and then, uh, and they could be trading at trillion dollar evaluations, but as long as they were the really good ones, then I think there'll be less cost to say there's a bubble. Uh, but when you have, uh, the kind of market where maybe the market goes up 10% in a day, and all of them go up 10%, including the really junky ones, or maybe the junky ones go up 20 or 30 or 40.

That's when, you know, we're in a very frothy environment. Um, so I think right now, at least the market isn't distinguishing quality. Um, now of course, quality is relative. Everyone has a different definition of quality. Um, but I think there are things out there that are like quite clearly Ponzi schemes and are even labeled as such on various websites, uh, that show them the market cap trackers.

Uh, but they tend to go up all the same kind of related to that. One of the things this year that surprised me most is. You know, the total market value for digital assets, uh, last year was 20 billion. And this year we've got two forks of Bitcoin, Bitcoin cash and Bitcoin gold that are now have an aggregate value of over 30 billion.

Um, do you, what do you make of that? Yeah. So the whole fork thing is really interesting. It's kind of nuanced. Uh, I can't just get up here and say forks good or forks bad. Uh, you know, that's too simple. Uh, and doesn't explain it. Um, so let me make the argument for where forks are good and where forks are bad and where forks haven't even been tested yet.

Um, so an example of where forks right. Uh, if you're thinking about a classic company, like if you're a Google and you need to figure out, for example, uh, is Google going to go into mobile phones or not? Or is Google going to go into ride sharing or not? Google has to make that decision. And then Google has to put resources behind it and whatever.

Fork in the road. Metaphorically speaking that Google does not take Google shareholders don't benefit or lose from that fork. So Google moves to the probability space of outcomes, making choices, whereas in a cryptocurrency space, you could say, Hey, the OD is figuring out a digital gold is a really hard problem.

Uh, and. And most universes, Bitcoin's not going to succeed. So if we just go and we just figured out one path and we try that, it's probably not going to work. So what the fork does is the fork allows the cryptocurrency because it's open source to pursue multiple paths simultaneously. And because it's pursuing multiple paths in the probability space, the odds that at least one of them will work are higher.

And therefore the combined value of the fork should be higher than just the value of Bitcoins. So that's the pro case for forks? Uh, the antique cares of course, is that along the way you split the committee? Uh, you create confusion, especially if there's naming confusion. Um, so it's really important that these four, except clear and distinguishable names that aren't tricking newbies and thinking, oh, that's Bitcoin.

And that they're also doing fundamentally, technically interesting things that aren't just marginally slightly different for us. They're actually very big existential risks, uh, at the end of the day. Currency is really community. So it's, it should have a certain amount of the community behind it. And the problem is that because these things can trade on one or two exchanges, they can be very heavily gamed.

You have no fee exchanges where people are trading with themselves. They can actually trick newcomers into believing that they have a community when they don't. It's really easy to create a Reddit group of the sock puppets who are pumping a coin, for example. So that's the kind of the case against. Um, so I think, you know, if you look at the, uh, Bitcoin cash versus Bitcoin, uh, argument, uh, that seemed like a legit argument between the miners and the developers.

And you could see that there are different people on both sides and yes, the majority are with classic Bitcoin and there's a significant vocal minority with, with, uh, Bitcoin cash. Um, But when you start getting to things like Bitcoin gold, it just seems opportunistic right now because I'm sure now we're going to see a Bitcoin silver Bitcoin diamond, diamond, platinum, Bitcoin, everything.

Right. At some point we have to say no, there's one thing called Bitcoin. You want to make anything else? Go give it its own names. It's hopefully it has technical merit. Hopefully it will have its own community. Uh, let it compete in the marketplace of ideas, but stop trying to steal the name, uh, and create confusion, frankly, uh, which will then cause regulatory action or losses or, uh, opportunity for fraud.

And I think this is where the exchanges can play a role. The exchanges can actually, uh, make sure that the names aren't in such a way that is confusing the customers. Um, and then on the fork side, I don't think we've seen everything yet. Uh, so far the vast majority of forks have. Fork the code, but keep the ledger intact.

So the big beneficiaries here have been the current Bitcoin holders. Like if you don't one of the early people who got into Bitcoin and you're sitting on tons of coin, you know, the, the Winkle boss and the Roger of errors and Satoshi's of the world you're doing really well here. Um, on the other hand, I could see someone coming along and saying, okay, thanks for helping us work out, which is the correct protocol to run.

That's the Bitcoin protocol. We agree with that. Uh, but we're going to have a one-time reworking. So it's a much fairer. However you want to define that distribution. Uh, maybe the governments of the world get together and give everybody each citizen, their share based on their producing a passport one time, uh, we redistribute the entire ledger, but we keep the code the same.

It's a one-time event. Then we carry on. And now all of a sudden this new Bitcoin call it fair coin is being accepted. You have 7 billion holders and maybe 3 billion, whoever can produce a passport. And as a participant in country, now how's the fair coin going to do against Bitcoin as a community is larger.

Um, you know, maybe it's, uh, it's enforced by the government when Bitcoin is not. So I think these you're going to start. Uh, private attempts to do that, where you're gonna have airdrops that are gonna be aimed at influencers. Airdrops are gonna be aimed at developers eardrops that will be aimed at, uh, kind of the general population.

Um, so this forking of the ledger and preserving the code is I think the path that hasn't really been fully tried yet. Cool. On time. I do want to see if anyone has any questions. Maybe we have time for two questions for novel. Um, Right here, runners in here that I kind of take the hikes. Thanks. I'm to stay here so we can, so a question about, so, you know, for those of us who are kind of high level, those of us who are, uh, you know, ignorant about the space don't know much.

If he lose Bitcoins. I mean, there is, is there any way to find them? No, it's a bearer asset. No recourse gone. Goodbye. Good luck.

That's that's why, by the way, I think the biggest problem in this space that is going to get solved in 2018 is custody. Uh, the Kool holds a Bitcoin. It's a beautiful idea to be your own. But if you're a prominent individual or if you're a funder in institutions, the last thing you want to do. Um, so I think people are very scared of this.

I think there's always the opportunity that you can hold your own coin if it comes to it. And that's what makes it different than our current financial system. Uh, however, I think for, uh, any. Like, if I'm putting any significant amount in you bet it's going to a third party custodian, or going to a find, I'm not figuring out how to like hold onto it myself.

Uh, the custody problem will get solved in 2018. Uh, ledger has a big infrastructure that they're rolling out. Enterprise grade Coinbase made an announcement. There's a new company that I'm advising called anchor. It was X Docker, X square people who are really brilliant, hardworking, um, and very good security people.

So I think you're going to see some really good third-party custody solutions and there's a race on for that. So I wouldn't be surprised if by Q2 of next year, you have very low priced or relatively low priced, but very high quality third-party custodians in the space, which will let you hold Bitcoin as a financial asset without having to hold it as a bearer asset where you're responsible for it.

Just one more question, uh, right here, NMO. Two questions.

Sorry about that. Before I know Venezuela is going to a lot of turmoil. What would your recommendation be for the crypto community here to help, uh, the citizens in Venezuela? And the second question is if Elon Musk wanted to do an ICO would use it. Um, I don't think Elon needs my support, nor does he need an ICO.

Ellen's figured out how to take money from the public markets very, very efficiently. Um, so I don't think he needs to do an ICO and I think the hype meter would go off the charts. If you combined Elon and Tesla and ICO, and it's just too much, um, Um, in terms of Venezuela, you know, the problem with Venezuela is inherently social.

It's not something we cause it's sort of like one more time, let's run the grand socialism experiment and see if we get any different results. And we always get the same results. I'm so sorry for those of you think it hasn't been tried enough, but it's been tried. Um, so I think the best thing we can do, I think the failure that we had, and it's not anyone's fault, but I just think the crypto community wasn't yet ready with easy, easy to use end user tools that would make it as easy for an end user to transact in cryptocurrency as they can impasse a user might in Africa, for example.

So we just still don't have easy enough to use wallets that you send around. Cryptocurrency understand what that means in your current Fiat context, get the money in and out. And the good news is that those tools are now being very, very rapidly built. For example, the hardware was didn't exist a couple of years ago.

The Bitcoin ATM's are sort of a recent thing. Um, so I think that that, that infrastructure finance layer, the financial infrastructure layer is being built out. Uh, and the faster that can be built out the better, I mean, I think we may have missed this time with Venezuela, like the country's a disaster right now, unfortunately.

Um, so the best thing we'll probably do is humanitarian contribute coin. Um, but, uh, I think at the next event as well, that happens and there's always inevitably one, cause there's always some kleptocracy or a dictatorship or a thug ocracy. Um, that's melting. Um, we need to be ready by making sure that the financial infrastructure to transact in cryptocurrencies for the average end user, is there an easy and stable and to ASHA's point earlier, like they're not scared of losing their Bitcoin, right.

They have some sort of a, a backup or a multisig or recovery or those kinds of things. Let's take one more question. What, why not? It seems that there is some interest. Uh, Dimitri Alima frontier ventures novel outside the financial services, which I understand the argument about, uh, what applications that are blockchain based in that truly deserve to be on blockchain.

Are you kind of most excited about name? Let's say three or four. Yeah. And explain why please. Yeah. What are the exciting applications outside of just pure financial? Well, I think anytime you're trying to organize a large network of humans to provide resources to each other. And especially if those resources are fungible in that, you know, you providing it versus me providing it as sort of the same thing.

And they're digitally on chain verifiable. In other words, a protocol can test to make sure you provided it as opposed to have to go talk to a judge or an external third party. I think those are the most interesting use cases. So, uh, one obvious example is file storage. You know, there's all this displaced lying around.

We have lots of, uh, excess file storage, um, and w you could build a giant grid computer that's serving up files that censorship proof, essentially all the things, the internet already. Like bandwidth routing file storage CPU, those kinds of things. They're already out there on the internet. Everybody has a bit of these resources.

We just want to contribute them together in some way, be able to keep track of them. So, uh, you know, uh, of course, you know, file coin and see a coin, a storage and a bunch of other. Networks trying to do that. Um, there's also kind of an edge bandwidth argument where we should all be hooking up wifi points and all be getting paid and wifi coin and paying each other and wifi coined to use wifi networks, uh, and eventually replacing the Verizon at and T T-Mobile oligopoly.

Um, so I think that could be an interesting use case. Uh, you could have a solar power network, uh, where we're basically putting energy into the grid and taking it back out of the grid and building a decentralized, uh, power network. Um, other examples, like if you had a very fast clearing coin or a microtransaction coin, you could use that, uh, in routers to basically give access to each other.

It's a DOL Hashcash vision of getting around denial of service attacks and having a payment for spam as an anti-spam measure. Um, you could also have self-driving cars. So if Elon wants to drive the hype meter off the charts, you know, Tesla's good exchange Tesla coin for rights away on the road. Um, or if we're charging and those kinds of things in a decentralized manner.

So I can pull up to a decentralized charger, paying Tesla coin, charge my car, then pay another Tesla, like a fraction of a cent to get out of the way so I can get to my destination faster. Um, so I think there's lots of interesting things you could have happen. Anytime you have a network where the resources are provided by a large community of average anonymous people, and you can verify that transaction on chain.

So those are the criteria I would use. We want to do one more. All right. Well, thanks, Paul. Did we have one there's one. Okay.

Hi, uh, it's VTL from token bubbles. Uh, so question it says beyond, uh, 2018, uh, when do governments get blockchain? Can you. Foresee the future and see when the world changes really, when do governments get blockchain? Well, you know, it's, it's a crazy concept. I don't think it's a question of when it's a question of how they get blockchain.

So one way of getting blockchain is saying, wow, this is a, this is the next generation of the internet. This is a brand new financial infrastructure and eventually internet infrastructure. And we want the innovation to happen. Uh, here. And so we want to foster those entrepreneurs. We want to get those tax dollars.

We want to get that innovation. We want to get that job creation. So that's one way to get it. And luckily the us is right now trending in that direction. Uh, although all it would take is one terrorist attack where they claimed it was financed by Bitcoin to turn that whole thing around. Um, the other way to get it is to say.

Oh, this is a threat to my ability to print money. This is a threat to my ability to freeze transactions on people that I don't like. Uh, and, uh, you know, and that's with the, to shut it, or this is a threat to my ability to put in capital controls and that leads to a crackdown. Um, and I've said this before, and I'll say it again, but I think the, the key insight.

Is that a code is just speech. Uh, and back in the nineties, uh, they were trying, uh, Clinton's government bill Clinton's government was trying to ban the export of strong cryptography and saying that it's a munition. And at that time, uh, I think it was Phillip Phillips Zimmerman. I could be wrong, but he famously wore a t-shirt around that had the encryption algorithms on his t-shirt like a very compressed, very simple form.

And he was making the point. Code is just speech. You can't ban code without banning speech. And there's, there's a reason why the first amendment to the bill of rights is the first amendment. It's the most important thing. It's the thing that all of our other freedoms rest upon. So in that sense, if you're in a crypto, you should be a free speech absolutist because if they can shut down any speech, they're going to come after your crypto next.

So speech is just a code is just speech and crypto is just code. It's just running code it's. You can shut down the ingress and the eagerness. From crypto to Fiat and Fiat to crypto. Uh, but you can't shut down crypto itself any more than you can shut down the internet. So I think fundamentally money code and speech are the same thing.

Uh, but the problem is we have all kinds of financial regulations that basically say, here's what you can and can't do with money, but we don't have the same level of speech regulations that say here's what you can and can't do at speech. So I think governments are going to have to reconsider. And the governments that choose well, I think will be the home to the next reserve currency and the next financial infrastructure.

And this one may be a winner, take all infrastructure. It may not be the case that you have a Hong Kong and a London and New York and a Singapore as financial centers. You may just only have one, which is the crypto financial center. And wherever that it's happening is where it's going down. So I think there's, uh, we're going to end up in this scenario where some countries are not gonna be able to reconcile this and they're going to want to extend their control.

Money into control over speech, and those are going to be very repressive regimes. And that's kind of going to be the big boss to fight here. Um, the final boss in the video game sense, you know, you can be your stage bosses and then you get to the big one at the end. So this, this may be the final boss. Um, and I think there are countries, hopefully that will figure out like, Hey, this is a chance to have the home of financial innovation, uh, next generation.

Uh, and money all be within our shores or mostly be our people. And I think those countries are going to do fantastically well. Um, so I think that's really the question. It's not when governments figure it out, it's how they figure it out, how they interpret it, uh, you know, relative to kind of their morals and their norms and their society.

Thank you. Awesome. Thanks. Fun chat.
