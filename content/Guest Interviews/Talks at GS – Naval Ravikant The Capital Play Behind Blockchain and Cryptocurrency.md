I am delighted to host Nevada con in this talk is the chairman and founder of angel list. He's also a founder and partner of the oldest. W a, a fund with incredibly compelling performance Ulta, an altcoin fund called meta stable capital. He's one of the most active angel investors in Silicon valley. Can you just tell us for the entire crowd to bring people level, you know, how do you define and think about what blockchain is and what cryptocurrencies are?

And let's just level set there and we'll go, go. So that'll take the next half hour, right? Uh, so cryptocurrencies are this very complicated thing. And I think everyone tries to describe them a slightly different way, depending on how they approach them. Uh, and, uh, it really, at the fundamental core of it is the blockchain.

The blockchain is an invention dating back to around 2009, which combines a few things. Public key cryptography, peer to peer networks, and most importantly, the solution to an old computer science problem called the Byzantine General's problem and what this does. And what that solution allows you to do is that allows groups of humans who are anonymous and don't know each other to establish trust with you.

Uh, and that is a fundamentally very, very important thing because in human history, we've only had a few ways to regulate large groups of humans. We've done that either through having a democracy where it's one person, one vote, or an aristocracy, we're an elites in charge or a monarchy or a king or a dictator is in charge or a corporation is in charge.

Uh, and now to that, we've added sort of a fifth way, which is groups of people can achieve consensus with each other on the internet, even though they don't know. And unlike a democracy, it's merit based. It's based on what you provide, uh, into the networks, the closest analogy would be like a market. Uh, anyone can participate in the market within reason like a stock market or the, or the credit markets.

Uh, but they're limited by the amount of capital they have. They have skin in the game. So blockchains allow you to bring that skin in the game, style, voting consensus, and aggregation of resources into all kinds of places where markets would normally not exist. Uh, and so that's really fundamental and it's allowing us to really.

Uh, things that normally required a centralized authority, uh, in a decentralized way. And the best examples are, uh, we're trying to remake store of value and money. Uh, with Bitcoin, we're trying to remake financial contracts with. Uh, we're trying to remake, uh, you know, things like, uh, fall storage networks with file coin identity networks of Blockstack and civic and so on.

So it's, it's really quite a technological revolution, uh, and layered on to that is this money revolution, which I think is what really attracts everybody's interest because everybody likes to make money. And, uh, what we've done now is because blockchains can allow people to gather together and contribute resources.

And create something new. You have to keep track of who contributed what resources and is owed something by the network. So there needs to be a ledger that keeps track of these things. And that basically ends up creating a currency by default. So blockchains end up being inseparable from the currencies that run within them.

The currencies are how you do the account. Um, so it's a, it's a really fascinating and deep field. What is the broadest impact do you think of this over time? Uh, absolute broadest impact is it could redefine how nation states function, how voting functions, how economies function, but that's a long ways out.

Uh, I think more in the short to intermediate. Uh, we're gonna redefine how, uh, how you can build a company, how you can build a network company. So it'll create an instant market economy with supply demand, currency settlement tracking of who's providing bandwidth, who's consuming bandwidth, uh, and we'll do that without anyone at the center.

There won't be any companies sitting at the center, collecting it, all, taking a tax and passing it on. It'll be purely usable. So you can see entire networks for power, energy, uh, bandwidth. Uh,  so physical, real world contracts that negotiate rights away and networks that negotiate rights away. That will be remade by the way.

In a world where the, the number of these kinds of opportunities proliferate, and there going to be a number of altcoins, what are the, um, disciplines or insights that you need to be a canny investor and to discern something that's really valuable from something that is, you know, a thinly veiled, white paper that hasn't been thought through very well.

Yeah. The scams are really good. They're not just good white papers. They're good code. And then there's backdoors in the code or. Subtle flaws in the game theory of the design that really favors one constituency over another. Um, internet protocols are really hard to design. There are maybe a few hundred engineers.

Who are really qualified to design the next generation internet protocol? Uh, likewise, I think they're really hard to invest in. I only think there's a few hundred investors who are qualified to invest in that because you, I don't think it's sufficient just to understand the game theory. Uh, you F you do have to understand the game theory.

You have to understand the economics of it. There's a little branch emerging called crypto economics, but you have to actually read the source code. You have to audit the wallets. You have to know how to actually store this stuff without it getting stolen. Um, you have to basically understand how the protocol mechanics.

You have to do a lot of analysis in the community. There's massive insider trading because there are no laws around this stuff. There's lots of gaming going on, where people are, uh, you know, they're, they're shorting, they're trading their own book. They're running bots. Uh, you know, there are some estimates, uh, in China until they started doing, uh, until the Chinese government cracked down on their exchanges earlier this year, they shut them down very recently, but when the crack, their first crack down came earlier.

Before they did that. 90 to 95% of the trades on Chinese exchanges were fake. It was people on zero fee exchanges trading with each other, trying to pump the price or dump the price and trick other people. So this is a very, very difficult discipline to invest in. And I think the skills that are required are extremely technical.

I don't, I don't think you can just pivot right into it. Okay. Now let's turn to, uh, capital formation. Your history is fascinating in this regard, which angel lists really tried and has been quite successful at changing the model of supplying capital to entrepreneurs. Um, in a more democratic way. What's your view on how all of these things will come to come together to change capital formation and coming here well, more and more of capital formation is going online.

Uh, more and more of it is being distributed. Geographic. Uh, more and more people are getting to play. Uh, and, uh, liquidity is coming back into the equation sooner, which I think is great news for all investors. Uh, along the way, though, anytime you take a small close network and you let the unwashed masses in a, it's going to be a lot more frothy, there's gonna be a lot more capital.

Uh, the existing players are going to complain a lot. Uh, people are going to get ripped off, but the distribution of returns is going to go to a larger swath of people. Um, one of the terrible things that happened in the last 20 years is companies started going public later on later. And the ability for Joe public to participate in their appreciation has just gone down, uh, you know, something like Uber is going way later in his life.

Than Amazon did. And even Amazon went public in its lifecycle later than Microsoft did. And that trend line is not getting better. So in some ways the ICO phenomenon, even though it has lots of problems, uh, the mechanism underneath it is a way to kind of get around that. Uh, and it's something that I think regulators are going to regulate, but they're fundamentally going to have a tough time because with ICO's what you've created is a digital barrier.

Uh, it's very hard to stop somebody from trading a bearer asset. You can say it, you can tell a US-based company, Hey, you're you have to follow the securities laws when your credit disaster minimums. Exactly. And that's what we're doing at CoinList and you know, people are doing that. So I think underlying all of this is that we've had all these financial regulations, but fundamentally money.

What we, what we don't realize is that money is just code that that's really what Bitcoin enabled money is just code and code is just speeding. It's a speech that's written down in such a way that a computer can understand. So you can't have free speech and constrained money. They sort of run against each other.

And it's very hard to constrict speech because humans are very talkative animals, right? So at the end of the day, uh, all these financial regulations are going to run up against this idea that humans speak and think freely. Um, so I think there's going to be a new normal that will get us established.

Talk a little bit about what you're doing with coin list and what you're trying to bring to this equation. So angel list was built. Place where we could do high quality, uh, early stage venture style deals, build portfolios, indices, and all that, uh, and do it online. And frankly, it was an uphill battle because the industry doesn't want to go online.

They're having a good time, but there's, there's already a lot of money in that ecosystem. Uh, despite that we managed to make some inroads over time. Uh, but when the ICO phenomenon came along, it was for a new class of things, protocols, which normally were not financeable by VCs. Um, so we saw with Angeles that our dream was sort of being realized in the ICO space, uh, and unique assets we have are the ability to run complex financial transactions safely online while complying with all the laws and rules and rules.

Um, so we work with protocol labs, who is a creator of file coin, and we spun out CoinList, uh, and CoinList is a legal regulated well-lit place to do ICO's this among others, you know, big Seminole technology trends in the world today are matters of national competitiveness, almost at some level. How do you think of.

The U S our regulatory framework, the IP around this. And if one country really leans into this, does that give them great advantage in the world of this new economy? It does, because it's something like a Bitcoin or Ethereum ends up being reserved currency. Uh, that's extra national for the world. Uh, the first country to really adopt it and drive it forward.

We'll just end up having the new reserve currency. So, uh, national competitiveness is a big deal. The U S has actually been fairly forward looking, uh, not withstanding a few silly things, like bit license in New York and whatever. Um, but generally the current STC stance is, uh, deregulatory. The Trump administration is very deregulatory.

Um, you know, they have the rule of like for every new regulation that they put out. The rural, rural to back. Uh, and I think they're generally pro innovation. So I think it's good news for cryptocurrencies for the next couple of years. Um, in China, they've done a number of about faces because the issue they're facing is you can't have capital controls and have cryptocurrencies.

You can't have constraints, speech and free cryptocurrency. So they're kind of going back and forth. But on the other hand, China realizes that these things are something they want to own. When they got into gold, they went and bought up a whole bunch of gold miners, a whole bunch of gold deposits because they want to own life.

They do that with all kinds of commodities and resources. And wouldn't it be great for them to go and capture, uh, you know, a reserve currency? Yeah, your point's an excellent one, which is maybe this will be defined by which national entity is willing to flex their own governance approaches to be closer to the model.

That's deeply decentralized, completely further. My really savvy friends. We talk in video game terms, you know, like you're in like a video game. You're always like fighting little bosses that you can go up stages. And so, uh, when like some crisis happens, like the fork and people panic, right. Small stage boss.

Uh, but the final boss is when the governments of the world decide what to do about cryptocurrencies on that note. Let's stop here and thing. And please join me in thanking the ball. Thank you. .
