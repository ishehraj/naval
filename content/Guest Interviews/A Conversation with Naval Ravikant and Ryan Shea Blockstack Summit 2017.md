![[y2mate.com - A Conversation with Naval Ravikant and Ryan Shea  Blockstack Summit 2017.mp3]]


All right. Well, thank you everyone. So, um, I have the pleasure of sitting here with Neval totally deja VU. Yeah. We just started from, um, I think we can all say that Nimol is one of the greatest minds in the space. Uh, he has

I mean, I don't know. It's true. Uh, but I'll, I'll, I'll spare you any further. Um, so. What do you to talking about? Well, this is the wine version of the conversation coffee version, so that we can want a little more relaxed, relax. A little bit. Cameras are off right now. Well, I wanted to ask you, what do you think about generally?

What's we covered this a little bit in the last panel, but what's going on with, what are we actually seeing with this interest in blockchains and tokens? Um, what is happening? What is money? Money is happening. Everyone thinks they can get rich. So everyone's really excited. Uh, lots of people who a year ago didn't know what a blockchain was and were Bitcoin disbelievers are now suddenly tokenizing their cap tables and coming up with all kinds of ways to.

Uh, I literally get an email a day from a company that has no business even thinking about ICO saying, how do we ICO? And I try and talk them out of it. And three months later, sure enough, half of them are really working on their token model. So that's kind of the bad part. The good part is, you know, whatever works because fundamentally blockchains are a wonderful invention.

It's a, you know, Satoshi Nakamoto, whoever he, or she, or they are, uh, you know, God bless them. They really created something that humanity there's the solve, the problem that humanity has never been able to solve before. And that problem is just, it's a governance problem. It's how do we organize networks?

And for those of you who've read sapiens, great book by Harari, highly recommended. He has this thesis where basically everything is a story. Money is a story. Corporation's a story. The U S government's a story. If we all start believing that story tomorrow would see. So humans are storytelling monkeys and these idea that we can unite each other by telling true stories, makes us the most powerful creatures in the world because we're the only animals that can unite across genetic boundaries, bees, and ants.

And so on can only can communicate within their genetic high, but humans can connect across genetic boundaries, but humans through stories can, you know, you can get 5,000 people together. The story that they're all Christian. And so then they all behave the same way or the story that they're American or they're capitalists or communists, or what have you.

So the storytelling power for humans is very powerful and these stories allow us to create networks. So money is a network United States then network Blockstack is a network communities or networks, the problem, which is how you run them. How do you organize humans? How do you, how do you decide who was in charge?

And historically the answers have not been. One answer has been that we get a king and authority, the most brutal person, the one with the biggest stick, and they tell everybody what to do. Uh, another is we have an aristocracy in elite, you know, it could be the American medical association. It could be the journalists, it could be the university system.

It could be Congress, whatever, but the elites tell us how to run out. Uh, another model is, well, it's a one person, one boat, it's a mob. It's the French revolution is the comments. Uh, and that can work in some cases, but it does have the tragedy of the commons. They're always cheaters. They're free-riders, uh, you know, you end up with the classic communist paradise, right.

Um, so the question is how do you organize humans? How do you organize networks? How do you organize decision-making and what's a Toshi Nakamoto. Was how to do it in, in an open way, like a democracy would, but still merit based where it's still based on some actual contribution to the network. So for example, in the Bitcoin network, the miners contribute hash power.

And so this is a fundamental breakthrough. What it does is it brings the power of market. Which are open meritorious systems and are now the most powerful networks in the world, just as any U S president has tried to go up against the credit markets. For example, the marketplaces are very, very powerful.

And what Satoshi did was bringing marketplaces into computer networks and from computer networks, they'll go out and physical networks. So it's a fundamentally different and new way of organizing as in humans. And that is fundamental. I mean, it took all this development. Five 7,000 years of civilization to get to the point where it can create a new way organizing humans.

And I'm just really happy to be alive at a time when it's being built. And so this is fundamental and if all it takes a little bit of greed to get everybody on board, that's fine. Let's do it all this pay that price, but I think money is bringing the end. But I think the thing that we're all creating is something far larger than that.

And far larger than money. So if you look at it that way, then it's not actually, uh, it's not actually, over-hyping it to say that this is the biggest thing that's happening since the invention of the internet. Yeah, I think it is. I think we're, we're probably overplaying the time, second part, and we're probably underplaying the decentralized decision-making part.

The decentralization part is key. Like the internet, when it first came out. I want you all to think back those of you around when the internet was first getting popularized, obviously. A long time ago, sixties ARPANET, but when it was getting popularized with web browsers in the late nineties, my impression was, wow, this is going to flatten everything.

There's going to be no middlemen, except the very merit-based there'll be no choke points. No. And little did I know meet your new overlords, Facebook, Amazon, Google, Twitter, snap, whoever they own all your data. They have their little digital prisons that they run. It's a great system. I mean, it looks it's better than the previous system, right?

It's better. Uh, the Washington post and the New York times being the arbitrators of truth in the wall street journal or whatever. So it is far more democratized, but looking at Netflix like a spider file, look at SoundCloud, the concentration of power that happens in these middlemen is ridiculous. It's so large.

So they're thin, layered. I mean, if I told you 10 years ago that the entire world's going to have one taxi dispatcher, you would have laughed at me. Right. But we there's, uh, there's original the world that ends up like that. So, uh, luckily I think this is an average. And for a little bit of time, I lost faith in the internet because the wall gardens and the centralized monopolists were winning over the democratized.

You want this stuff to be democratized, but I think the reason is because the underlying internet protocols were essentially. In the sense of tragedy of the commons. Like everyone can use the commons, but everyone can abuse the comments. So now with blockchains, we're building internet protocols that no allocate scarce resources that say, no, you can't just use all the server power.

You want all the bandwidth you want. No, you can't have all the money you want. You have to basically pay for this. You have to exercise some merit into the system. So I think over time, we'll see solar grids, electric grid, self-driving cars. That will essentially be machine run and controlled and illustrated by blockchains, they will be decentralized.

So I think we're now the direction of the internet has shifted. It has gone from having lots of overly expensive middlemen to having a few thin middlemen. And now it's going to go to having no middlemen or just the absolute minimum and the internet is going to become a giant. So 10 years from now, 20 years from now, the question of like, where do you host your files is going to be a nonsense question.

It's going to be on the internet, obviously, right? Like who's controlling which self-driving car fleet you subscribe to. Well, the Internet's self-driving car fleet. So I think as humans, again, we've created something larger than ourselves and that thing is learning how to organize itself. I don't want to get into AI visions.

I don't think it's conscious at the same level we are, but it's an emergent property. Uh, and so that decentralization, the arc of the internet is now bending back towards decentralization, which I think is a very, very powerful thing. And so we're bending towards decentralization. Um, um, what are, you know, I think two questions to ask her, like, how could that go wrong?

Like we at least believe that this is happening. If it doesn't, if it didn't end up happening, let's say 20 years from now, why was that? What went wrong. Um, and then too, when we, as we're getting here, what are the main benefits of this? Why is this actually, I guess I, how could I go wrong? Well, I think with the brilliant of this, the brilliant thing this time around is there's of course, computer science, probably the Byzantine General's problem that was solved that allows us to do all this, but there's money attached to this time.

So the incentives are very, very powerful. If you want to spread. Attach an incentive to it, right. Create an economic system around that message that makes people's lives better. And that works. So I think in that sense, it is a powerful spread back there. That's why I was kind of saying in the earlier panel, it would be nice to see these blockchains actually having a use case too, because the money thing only goes so far without a use case.

Eventually the money has to translate to utility or it has to allocate utility. Um, so how it could go wrong. Obviously the incumbents that be, aren't going to give up power that easily, right? If you're a king or a dictator or your nurse, the crab, or you're in a lead, or you're a big company, or you're a regulator, or you're a government, you're not going to like most of this, uh, you know, most of this is about making the individual sovereign, not the king sovereign, not the elite sovereign.

Um, so any, any anyone who is in a privileged position of power, And that is probably like, actually most of us in this room are in some sense in a privileged position of power, but let's, let's put that aside. Yeah. Watch out. Yeah. Anyone who's power you're descending into a market-based meritocracy for everything.

And for if you thought you were going to sit on your laurels because you gotten your degree or you were at a certain part in life or cause, or cause you start a certain institution, that's not going to work well for you. I think regulators are going to have a really tough time with it. I think legislators are going to be really tough.

Uh, I think as usual, the hope there is that the pace and scope of innovation is so quick, uh, that it outpaces, uh, uh, them, um, you asked like why decentralization matters. Uh, you know, when you're trying to figure out why anything matters, you can, there's a tendency that we have to like give a laundry list of reasons and sometimes just one or two reasons as big enough.

So I just want to focus on the really, really big ones. Um, One big one is you're now going to be in charge of your identity. That is super valuable. I know we don't think of it that way, but we live in a full surveillance society right now, which is really a scary thing. And it's not, there's the NSA servers and then there's Facebook surveillance and there's Google surveillance.

And then that data and identity that they have also creates massive lock-in and Kris switching costs. It makes it very hard for you to leave and it makes it hard for you to leave in other subtle, insidious ways. Like Google is not only the largest search engine. They're also the largest ad network and Facebook is a big ad network.

So other people just came in. Compete with them because they don't have the critical mass for advertising because they don't have the data. And the whole thing locks into it. Uh, so I think you, the owning your own data and identity is a step towards personal freedom and it matters for that level. Uh, censorship resistance is a big deal.

May not feel like it to people in the United States, uh, but to people living in parts of the country, uh, parts of the world, sorry, where the currency is being debased, or you're told what you can and you can't say, um, censorship resistance is a. YouTube and Twitter brought down entire governments in the middle east.

I would argue YouTube and Twitter brought down the government in the United States. The populous revolts that we've seen, the populous revolt that we saw from the right, with all Trump and from the left with Bernie Sanders would not have been possible without social. Or crowdfunding because especially Bernie Sanders, he raised small dollar from small dollar donors.

And I think from here on out, we will never see another elite president in the United States. We're not going to see another Clinton or Bush or anyone that looks anything like them elected. I think it's all Trump's and Sanders from here on out. Scary as that sounds, it's all populous because it's all social media is wearing the show.

It's decentralized. So decentralization in this case, it levels the playing field. It allows many more voices to be heard, and it is a form of censorship. And then the third reason that I would articulate as to why decentralization matters, because now these systems are, we're getting into laundry list territory, watch out just three.

And they're all kind of very related it's about who owns the thing, right? That's what it boils down to, since it ship resistance, open development and owning your data identity, or just a different way of saying it's open. That's all it is today, but what made the internet so powerful as compared to every other computer network that had come before it's open?

That's the why is open data important? Because without open data, you don't, you don't have permissionless innovation, you're back to a king or a, or a, or a company owner telling you what you can and can't do. And all the innovation comes from a small number of very young people who are. And the older people in charge don't want to break the rules.

That's why we have to die for the human race to move forward. Right? It's like the old saying science advances, one funeral at a time. It's absolutely true. Technology advances, one funeral at a time business advances, one funeral, the human race advances, one funeral at a time, the people who are in charge of before half they die.

So we can create a new system. Uh, and that only happens when you let the young people innovate and it's an, a permissionless fashion. So it needs to be an open decentralized system. I think we make the centralized computing too. Yeah, we should decentralize everything. Whereas with blockchains, we're going to decentralize all the things that doesn't mean there won't be bottlenecks.

Uh, there are always areas where you will have natural network effects. What are the most important things to de-centralize? Like, what are the, if you were to say these are like critical level threat, um, this is most eminent will impact society in the greatest way we have to decentralize this. That's a good question.

I haven't really thought about it before, so it's not very exhaustive, but I would say money is a big one. Right? That's what I would say. Identity is a really big one. That's what you guys are trying to do. Data is a big one. And I think people like file coin and the others will sort of help with that.

You're also helping with that, but identity and data are kind of. Right. They're they're building blocks. They're building blocks. We're still, oh, I think I would like to see social media decentralized one step further, because right now we've traded dozens of newspapers and TV stations, which are very centralized.

Yeah. I'd like to see Twitter and Facebook and snap and those kinds of things decentralized as well, just from a personal human perspective, from an investor perspective. And we're going to make money off of it. But from a human perspective, I don't want my kid using Twitter or Facebook. I don't want my kid like farming on Zach's farm or Dorsey's farm, you know?

But some point, those, those are, those are long lived information. Monopolies is what we've constructed and it's going to take a platform, shifted, displaced them in blockchains, offer that kind of platform shift. Now there's a very, very works number one. Well, it is a very powerful, perfect, like just creating a decentralized social network.

Doesn't mean people got right onto it, but there's a set of people who cannot go on Twitter or Facebook today because they're worried about. Because of where they live or because maybe they have opinions to say that Facebook doesn't allow anonymity. So maybe there'll be some anonymous people. I don't know.

It wouldn't necessarily always be for good things. Like when the internet first developed, there was a lot of unsavory stuff on there, but that's kind of what it takes. You have to go through that phase. It's a net positive you're making. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, at the application level, it's hard to predict, but for example, You know, you could take, you could take PG and E and you could replace it with a decentralized solar grid grid.

That's organized by blockchains. Um, wouldn't it be great if we kind of all own the power grid as opposed to having some, all state monopoly do it? I think as George would tell you, sorry to keep pointing out, George Gilder, you know, the history of energy use is in some sense, the history of the human species.

Uh, what we do is we. More and more available power from the environment and put it to use. So we're, we are energy consuming. So creating a decentralized energy and power grid would actually increase the scope of all human innovation. You could have a decentralized communications grid. I'm sure you all love Comcast and Verizon and at, and T you know, there are wonderful companies, but it would be nice if each of us plugged the wifi access point into our home, that then broadcast a cell signal.

And we got paid in wifi coin based on how much network coverage we were providing. And we had to pay out wifi quite automatically, our phones do it on the fly to connect into the grid. And then. Not unlimited because you're limited by the air, but there would be a certain amount of physics, but you would have as much bandwidth as possible.

And you will have, we're going to hear from a mesh networking startup after this. Fantastic. We only need a bunch of those kinds of efforts. You could have a distributed anonymity grid, which would be interesting for people who are trapped behind a firewall or in a place like Iran or something like that.

So I think there's going to be, there's gonna be a bunch of these things. These applications that'll be useful. It's really hard for me to sit up here and predict. It's like sitting up here in 1992 and saying, oh, HTP is being put together. What are you thinking? And by definition, anything you predict is going to be wrong, right?

Cause it's like, it's always something new that comes along. It's not even replacing the old things. Maybe a better way to look at it. Wouldn't be what you think is most important for everyone else. But what you personally would use, I want free media. I really want free media. I think that free media, uh, you know, even though you may not want to hear it, I think everybody has a right to say something and there's going to come a day when every human being on the world is going to be able to reach every other human being.

Uh, and it makes it really hard to commit true injustices when you can shine a flashlight like that. And snarky joke that gets 50,000 retweets, or unfortunately the jokes will always get a lot more retweets than like the actual pain and problems. Uh, I think as a society we'll have to adapt. I think a lot of people will go get driven crazy by Twitter and Facebook, just because now all of a sudden you can have 7 billion people's problems exposed to you.

Whereas normally, historically you would only have the a hundred people who lived around you in your tribe. Certainly if like all the stuff that my aunts and uncles forwarded to me on WhatsApp is any indication where they're not quite adapted to all the things going wrong in the world yet. But I think the kids will be adapted to it.

Uh, the kids are going to use media in ways that we can't even begin to imagine. And they already are. I mean, like I, I'm not using Snapchat. I couldn't figure it out. Uh, but that already tells me I'm behind. So w do you think it would be safe to say that society will be radically different 10, 20, 30 years from now the way sort of what it is and how would he be?

I mean, we covered a little bit, it follows technology. I think, I think technology actually leads society. Like a society of cave, men and cave women is very differently organized in our society is, and technology allows us to reorganize. Um, and we'd like to pretend that like society controlled technology, but it can't really the Promethease story about fire being passed down or biting from the tree of knowledge.

Sounds like the logic of violence a little bit. Yeah, that's right. There's the sovereign individual thesis. If you haven't read that book, it's worth reading it. Basically the thesis there is that the structure of society actually follows the logic of. So whoever can commit the most violence. They get to organize society and then society has to follow that person.

And so that might've been a king or a feudal system in the old days, and then it might be a nation state currently. Uh, but eventually it will be the individual and the individual will organize their own little society, uh, because they're going to have ability to hold onto their assets in a waste. They don't today that could be taken away through violence.

I'm not going to do justice to it here. I did 36 tweets on that one. Right. I was a 36 tweet tweetstorm I was trying to explain that it's a pretty incredible book to myself, more than anybody else, but yeah, sovereign individual is a great book. I highly recommend it society. I think it's going to look completely different.

Paul Graham famously said the future is already here. It's just unevenly distributed. If you look at how blockchain developer teams work, for example, open. Uh, often anonymous individuals sometimes paid sometimes not often have holdings in the coin, scattered all over the world, know merit based in a weird way.

If they disagree, they fork, they exit, they split off rather than try to resolve it through violence or some other traditional means. Um, that may be a better way to predict how society is going to be organized and how it is. Um, you can already tell if you're building a company today, like 10 years ago, you would have had to say, I'm going to bring together 10 engineers, five designers, five marketers, and put them all under the same roof.

Right. That assumption is already disappearing in the blockchain space. I think one of the absolute best things about the blockchain space is that it is not concentrated in Silicon valley. I think that is a huge positive, and it is an indicator of the democratization. And yeah, I get it. We get together here, but there's also big gatherings of blockchain people elsewhere in the world to utilize MeetSpace a little bit.

Yeah, absolutely. And it's good for now, but when VR catches up, you can still have virtual conferences and you can kind of squint and you can see the pieces coming together. Like even to the extent that we're having this physical conference, 90% of the knowledge that you have picked up about blockchains, you picked up.

Twitter, email documents, papers, white papers, slack forums. This is just like the last five, 10% connecting it to faces in humans. What about countries like China that suppressed blockchains? How are we gonna get around that? So it's a good question. I think there, I'm not a protocol developer, so I don't have the answers, but what I'm hoping is that there's two classes.

Um, actually, it's really just one class of solutions while two. Okay. One is you make cryptocurrency a part of the internet. And the way you do that is today. The reason we have DDoSs and we have spam is because routers don't know how to allocate scarce resources. Like every packet that comes in the router just passes it on every packet that every request that hits your server, your is going to respond.

But in the future, if a router has to pay a trillionth of a cent to pass. A packet or has to pay a browser as to pay the server obviously requires a new cryptocurrency. It doesn't exist yet. It has to be stable as we low fees, as they clear nearly instantly. So it's maybe different than network, but if those kinds of cryptocurrencies are required for efficient networks to operate, then eventually those countries will face a choice of, do we get left behind or do we just upgrade?

That's one. Yeah. Hashcash was originally designed as an anti-spam solution. And as part of the Bitcoin protocol that you need, one of the primitives, the second way it could happen is just that the, the abundance that cryptocurrencies allow and create their blockchains allow and create, um, then requires you to adopt them.

For example, even China is adopting markets. China has public markets, the Shanghai market stock exchange, for example, uh, and if my articulation is, is correct, then. Blockchains are basically creating markets and all digital assets. So is China going to decide that? No, no, we don't want markets. Um, you know, there is a, there is a conspiracy theory view of the world that the current Bitcoin scaling.

Is really about Chinese miners versus kind of international or American developers. And that we may see a split into a China coin and a us coin or something of the sort. Right? Because I think China is very forward-looking. I think when they looked at cryptocurrencies early on my guesses, first, they wanted to suppress it or control it.

Cause they didn't want the capital flight out of the, but then I think very quickly they realized like, wow, this could be the next goal. This could be the next reserve currency. And if it's going to be. Uh, it's going to displace the dollar, cause it's not like we, the Chinese control all the gold and all the reserve currency.

So why don't we just scoop up as much as we can. And then next thing you know, all the miners are Chinese, right? So I think that, I don't think the Chinese are anti cryptocurrency. I think they are in a process of modernizing their state and converting into maybe not a liberal democracy, but a much more open society.

And I think cryptocurrencies can be part of that. If the incentive structure is laid out the right way, That gets to the next question, which is if blockchains are the, are the base layer, what do you see as becoming the layers of, of, of development or the protocol stack for these applications? Yeah, it's, it's really early.

I mean, obviously we have something here called Blockstack, right? You guys are trying to build a stack. Uh, the Bitcoin blockchain, which I think it's, I think Blockstack is interesting for a couple of reasons, by the way, when I invested it was one name. So I don't think any of us had any idea of what we were doing.

No, that's not true. You were still doing identities on top of name coin, so I'll give you credit for sticking with the original vision, but now it's like a virtual blockchain on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. Um, and so there's a couple of interesting pieces there. I think of it as like you're kind of being TCP IP to the basic Bitcoin IP, right.

You're adding more state into this. Um, you're keeping track of identity. You keeping track of data, which is a form of state TCP IP does session tracking on top of IP. So it keeps track of a little bit more state. So Blockstack is an example of a layer, two protocol that is emerging on top of the layer.

One protocol of Bitcoin and is cleverly virtually designed. So if something goes wrong with Bitcoin, you can move it over. Um, so it's kind of cleverly future-proof that way. I think we're going to see more of that. I mean, you look at the classic OSI stack, it's seven layers of computing. Um, and there's probably is a lot more it's just after HTP, it gets too complicated and confusing.

So people stop trying to create more layers. Um, but I think that you guys are a great example of that. We're going to see, we're going to see more of that. Like the attention tokens, advertising, tokens, prediction markets. These are probably not all layer one protocols. Some of them are layer two. We might even see.

Um, but it's, it's really hard. You just have to squint a lot. One of the nice things about being a developer in this space or being involved in the space again, the token incentive. So I've seen lots of developers who were into Bitcoin in 2013, they started companies and the companies failed. And in any other industry or in any other technique technology.

They would have just failed. So it's like, okay, I failed that sucked. Now it turns out that even though they fail along the way, because they were in Bitcoin space early, maybe their company failed, but they got paid in Bitcoin, whatever revenues they collect, they were in Bitcoin. Or they bought some Bitcoin on the side or they just even got to know all the Bitcoin people in and on Ethereum ICO.

Most of those early developers are actually pretty well off to hell. Right? So in a space like this, that is growing and has a powerful monetary incentive. It's like if you're the, if you're one of the early people to figure out how stock markets. You know, whether you bought, whether you started the right company or not, just because you had that knowledge early on, you were just exploiting an arbitraging, kind of a, an unlevel playing field or at a less well-known.

I remember the blog post by Fred Wilson. That was the no hands effect. Do you remember that is a famous saying by Warren buffet about the clock. Yeah. He basically says that. Whenever there's kind of a bull market. Warren kind of says, it's, everyone's partying like Cinderella at the ball, right? It was like all the stagecoach men around.

There's like great music. There's great food. There's champagne flowing. Everyone's dressed up. Everyone's had a great time. And they know that at midnight, the stagecoach men are going to turn back into rats and the coaches are going to turn into pumpkins and the wind will turn into water and the whole party we'll come to an end, but they all plan on being out at 1150 or 1159.

Right. They're going to rush. The problem is the clock has no hands, uh, like nobody knows what the, what the actual time is. Um, and that's kind of the party that's going on right now. That's that's the buffet explanation. I actually don't think that's correct. I don't think that's true in the blockchain space.

Oh, I was referring to when Fred Wilson said that there was a time and I think it was 2014 when for when he went into a meeting with a large number of investors and he said, who is, who would buy Bitcoin or invest in a Bitcoin startup right now? And no one raised. And I think that's just something for us too.

It's like right now, we're in this, in this period, exuberance, but there's, there's, you know, there's, there's periods in which there's lots of excitement, there's periods in which there's less, uh, less public. I think there's troughs and valleys. And we have to make sure that we're in it for the long haul and that we remember what we're actually here for, and that when things, when the, when things change and when the sentiment changes, we just have to make sure that we.

Yeah, absolutely. That's sad. I think even today that 99% of people and probably 90% of serious financial investors still don't understand what's going on here. Um, so there's still way more opportunity on the unaddressed side than there is on the address side. Um, and this believers come and go, but fundamentally for the right reasons, if you're here and you're here because you love technology or you love decentralization and kind of what it means for the human race, then that's its own reward.

Getting paid for it. Yeah. May work may not. Um, but I think in the long run it'll work out fine. Like if you look at the 1999 bubble, the exuberance, I mean, I was there during that. Um, I remember in 2000 there were a bunch of bumper stickers around saying, dear God, please give me one more bubble. I'll know exactly what to do.

Right? So here we are. Um, yeah, around the 1999 bubble, you knew it was a bubble. You knew there was a lot of crazy stuff going on by the way, that bubble was way bigger than this one. That was a $1.7 trillion bullets peak here. We're not even at a hundred billion dollars total. And. That one, there was also a huge debt bubble associated with, there was a lot going on there, but during that bubble, you knew there was a lot of junk.

There was the pets.com and there was the web band. And I don't mean to pick on those companies. They're actually later at PetSmart and Instacart and so on and turned out to be very valuable. So the timing was off, their intentions were good, but there was a lot of bad stuff from an investment perspective.

Nevertheless, if you had that's when Amazon was created, that's when Google was created, that's when eBay was free, that's when Craigslist was created. So there was enormous wealth creation going on, even at that. And I think today, the news came out that, uh, Jeff Baylis is now the richest man in the world or something like that, or the richest self-made person in the world.

I forget what it is. He's just passed bill gates and network. Um, so when that happened, that basically tells you the internet revolution has now overtaken the PC revolution, right? It's been, uh, 20 years for the internet revolution to overtake the PC revolution. It might take 20 years for Satoshi Nakamoto to overtake Jeff Bezos.

But I think it will. All right. I think that's a great note to close on.
