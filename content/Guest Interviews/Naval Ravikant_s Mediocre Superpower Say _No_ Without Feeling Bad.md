My mediocre superpower. If this qualifies miracle enough, would be having the ability to say no without feeling guilty. And, uh, I kind of feel like, especially now with Angeles, we're in this position. Where we've sort of taken on the mantle of trying to help all the startups and you can't help all the startups.

Most of them are not ready to be funded. Most of them do not deserve to be funded. You can't meet with them all. They all want to meet with you. They all want personal time. They all want personal advice. Um, and you have to triage. And so you have to say no all day long. And when you say no, you just feel bad.

Cause that's, you know, you're setting out to do the opposite. Um, and so I'd just love to be able to say no without feeling bad. And make my day a lot easier. I ended up in a lot of meetings that I feel guilty. I get guilted into them, but I really don't want to be eating. I want to get out. Ellucian could have been a way for you to say yes to everything.

Would you just want to be let off the hook? Oh you, but that wouldn't be a mediocre superpower. If you could say yes to everything, then you know that stuff. That's a real superpower, I suppose. Right. Um, how many meetings? Cause you seem like a pretty blunt guy. I'm surprised you got guilty. No, God, I'm ruthless about killing, uh, useless.

Uh, I own the domain. I don't do coffee.com. So the jerks for a while at the same responses from Nepal that I don't do coffee.com, but that was too much of a jerk. Um, and I like coffee and San Francisco's great coffee. So, um, I still do a couple of meetings, but I really try and solve everything by email first, say, look, if it's, if it can be solved by email, let's do that.

Cause then you can help 30 companies in the same time period. You could have met one or if he can't do that, let's do a phone call. And if he can't do that, then let's do a Skype. If you can't do that, let's do a meeting. Let's bundle them together. There's four of them in one hour and just be very efficient, cut to the chase and actually harvest tagger from YC told me this, that, you know, when he shortened the amount of time that he spent in office, Um, it got way more efficient.

There was just, there's no time for someone to come in and kind of start doing the pleasantries. They know they have 15 minutes for the next guy walks in. So they're just more efficient. And I would say to startups, like, don't spend your time doing meetings unless you really, really have to. I really think networking is over right.

Uh, there's all these articles about like, oh, you had a network more and this is how you, but it makes me want to vomit, right? Go do something great. And your network will instantly emerge if you build a great product or if you get a good customer base, I guarantee you, we will get you funded. You will not have to go take internal meetings, building relationships, years in advance, uh, all that meeting stuff you're doing shaking hands, um, you know, do it for recruiting, do it to learn from really, really smart people.

But you gotta make sure you have something to offer them too. Otherwise you're just take. But just sort of networking. If you're standing around an event with a name tag and a glass in your hand, and then that kind of includes this event. Think about it sort of you're doing it for entertainment. You're doing it because that's your leisure time.

This is, this is not your work time. This is your leisure time. Yeah. Let's just be clear for those of you who told you coworkers? Oh, I'm going to an important, no, it's not work. This is entertainment. If the beer and pizza didn't tip you off.
