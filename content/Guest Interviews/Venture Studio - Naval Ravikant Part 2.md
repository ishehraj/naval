![[Ep 31 - Naval Ravikant - AngelList (2 of 2).mp3]]


Welcome back to venture studio and welcome back to our fantastic two-part interview with Naval Ravikant of AngelList. If you missed part one, go check it out@venturestudio.org or on iTunes, SoundCloud, Stitcher tune in Google play or wherever else you get. Your podcasts. Venture studio is the podcast where your host Dave Lerner entrepreneur angel investor in 60 plus companies and director of entrepreneurship at Columbia university interviews, the angel investors and VCs who make up new York's entrepreneurial ECOS.

As always I am your producer, Kevin Weeks. And part one of this interview, Dave, and have all talked about AngelList, syndicates and startup funding. In part two, things got quite a bit more philosophical in this interview, Dave, and Neval cover power dynamics and haters and venture capital, the American political system, everything from Trump to Bernie, to Hillary, the disruption of the wealthy elite.

And of course, south. And with that, let's head on up to the venture studio office for part two with Naval Ravikant. Yeah.

People are very supportive of what you're doing. A lot of people in the ecosystem, see this unbundling, this, this democratization, the ease at which this stuff can be set up, these syndicates, et cetera. And then you have a smaller percentage that are quite critical from the background. How do you look upon that?

Or you're a philosophical guy. You know, people are taking shots at you from the sidelines and critiquing these new models. How do you think about it? I mean, critics are always there, right? There's always somebody who is saying you can't do that. The world is full of that. And we all, we all know what's going on in those people's heads.

Right. They're not trying to be helpful. The thing is the helpful critic for the sidelines taking shots at you. And then they'll hide behind things like investor protections, but you know, our returns are there. We're making returns. Uh, these backers and the institutional funds would not be coming home.

Believe me, nobody commits half a billion dollars to checking your returns. So, uh, you know, I'd say, let, let the market play it out, uh, to the critics. I don't know. I mean, it's just go find something better to do with your. Don't don't you have anything real to do, to do anything, to build, uh, you know, don't, you have anything positive to contribute to this world and I'm sure you do.

So go do that, right. Go, go lead by example, don't lead by criticism. So I don't, I try not to be critical. I, and everyone is right. It's, it's hard to manage that within yourself, but I find that when I am being critical of somebody else, uh, it's it's a form of self. It's something that's attacking my ego, uh, or something that's attacking, maybe the way I make a living or someone that's got contradicting, the choices I've made.

Uh, and so I'm lashing out in anger, uh, and, and, you know, there's a great. Saying that like, you know, anger is a, is a hot call. You hold in your hand while you're waiting to throw it at somebody. Uh, and always like that. So I'm, I don't even pay attention to them. Right. Uh, look, it's a, it's a, it's a grand experiment that seems to be working so far in a, in a certain part of the industry.

Uh, if it continues to work, we'll continue doing it. If it doesn't work, we'll stop doing it. Uh, you know, everyone who is involved as sophisticated and adult, some people are making quite a bit of money doing it. Some people will probably lose money, like happens in any market. Um, yet when someone lose money trading on the NASDAQ, we don't shut the NASDAQ down.

Exactly. Uh, and when you look at the public markets, most of the trading that goes on the public markets, 99% is secondary, right? Right. You could argue that's more casino, like best people just trading. And it's good because it creates liquidity in those markets. But nevertheless, it's secondary trading.

The primary offerings in the public markets are very small and far and few between and primary offerings are critical because they provide capital to enterprises to go out and build. And what we're basically doing is we're purely primary market. There's no secondary trading going on. So we are, we are providing primary capital to.

Uh, lifeblood companies, you know, who are startups, who are making the world a better place. Um, so yeah, I mean, the funny, the funny thing is the criticism in this industry. One of the things I find very disingenuous about it is that criticism in this industry is not as much driven by merit as it's driven by power.

Um, and so what happens is that whenever you try anything new, the powerful attack you, and then, uh, when that new thing itself becomes successful and powerful, they stop attacks. Not because they come back and they say, oh, well it turned out. It worked, but it's because you're powerful though. So I see this happen with all the accelerators where the accelerators movement and the few first few accelerators, including YC used to get attacked.

Now they don't get attacks that are powerful, uh, same way the new venture funds like Andreessen and shortest route. And all those people used to get attacked and other, they don't get attacked. Uh, and, uh, it's just, it's, it's silly, but it's about power. There's a mob mentality. Um, so yeah, so there are still people who kind of whisper about us behind closed doors, but I think now they're becoming cognizant of the fact that we're on nearly a thousand captains.

We have hundreds of angel investors out in the field. We have lots of people using the platform who are happy and doing deals. Uh, and if you're going to attack the way that they're making a living well, these people are upstream of most venture capitalists. So you're not going to see their deals and every smart venture capitalists, all the good old school ones, you know, you go to Sequoia, you go to Kleiner, you go to, um, you know, you, you go to any of the top old school VCs and they stay out of the fray, right.

They just stay out of the fray because they. That even though the industry has. Rules, even those rules are subject to change. Um, you know, and, and things do change the dynamic industry. Who's to say that the tech industry is going to change, but somehow venture capital is going to be unaffected. That's just silly.

So I think the smarter VCs just sort of say, you know, let's see if it works. We'll, we'll give it a shot. We'll see if it works. Um, Philosophical approach and make, it makes so much sense. I have to say, you know, you really are like a quiet revolutionary, what you've done here. And I dunno, six, seven years, uh, is quite profound.

And, and I want to explore that a little bit with you. You recently wrote this incredible piece called American spring on medium. Yeah. You talked about how, and I recommend everyone read this. I'm going to quote from a, from a few lines there in a minute. It's basically you talk about the un-bundling of the elite power structure of the political landscape and of the media of the mainstream media.

I'll read some quotes. You say the elite. A plutocracy of the top few percent bought the parties. So cheaply. In fact that they bought both one weakness. The presidency is a single office of great visibility and power directly and democratically elected one person, one vote, regardless of education ethic, breeding knowledge achievement is everyone actually really equally qualified to vote the elites.

Today, it's a different world, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook. Let one human broadcast to billions without permission, without sensors, without delay. And you talk about Bernie Sanders. You talk about Trump, uh, very prescient. Um, in the last few days, Trump won the Republican nomination. Uh, something is going on here in politics.

Talk to me about that phenomenon. Yeah. I mean, generally I try and stay out of politics because I think politics is the exercise of power without Barrett. And, uh, and it's a spectator sport. Politics is, you know, people form tribes often, geographically based, often based on where their friends are. And then they drum out anyone who's not politically inclined with them.

It's a very tribal behavior. And then they cheer people on and the whole thing is kind of mindless, uh, and in a purely irrational utilitarian sense. Yeah, voting is a free rider problem. Like purely rational people don't vote. So in some, in some sense there's always emotion involved in politics, uh, and a lot of emotions.

So it's a very difficult topic to deal with. And when you read political commentary, I would say 99% of them are blind and they are blind because they've picked a site because they want to see what's going to happen. Uh, they w they want something to happen a certain way. And so therefore they're drowning in confirmation bias.

Um, so if you want Bernie to win, you're, you're reading, you're reading all the Bernie news outlets. You want Trump to, when you're reading all the Trump news outlets, you want whoever to win. You're winning really. Hillary use outlets and you're cheering your tribal long while you kind of hurdle insults and, uh, and tomatoes and exit the other tribe.

Right? So I find politics. It's a total minefield to walk into that. And let's caveat that, that we're not talking about any candidate in talking about phenomenon. Let's say someone who wants to throw a hot coal at us. It's very clear that we're not endorsing that candidate. You're talking about. Yeah, that's not a disclaimer.

That's basically saying that if you want to understand what's going on, then you have to look at it with no preconceived judgments. Um, and that, I think that's generally true in life. That's not just true in politics. It's true in business. When you're making a decision, that's true and falling in love.

It's the, the more of a preconceived notion you go in with the less you're going to actually see what's happening. So with that mindset, that's why I approached this. And I said, Essentially the two party system that we run run under, it's a conspiracy to monopolize the vote to monopolize the vote.

Originally the founding fathers, I think were against the idea of political parties, but they couldn't figure out a way to stop political parties without also restricting freedom of speech. And freedom of speech is critical. It underlies the entire foundation ocracy that we have today, or the Republic that we have today.

Uh, there's a reason why it's the first amendment in the bill of rights, not the second or the third one. Well that freedom of speech, you can force anything else for the people. So freedom of speech is fundamental. The problem is we have a first past the post system. In other words, it's a winner. Take all.

If you get 51% of the voters, then you get the entire presidency. So then of course you get political parties and political parties are formal conspiracies to monopolize the vote. And you can't have three because the moment. Three number two and number three are under pressure to gang up to beat number one, because the number one, all this takes everything.

It's a winner take all. So therefore we're in a winner, take all system with, with, uh, freedom of speech. So you end up with two political parties. Well, you would think that these two political parties would represent a lot of choice, but they don't. If you look at them, curiously, the differ on the details, but they don't differ on the broad things.

What do they agree on? Uh, the big political parties? They both agreed upon bailing out the ban. Pink trillions of dollars to the banks to build them out for gambling losses. Essentially both political parties agree on fighting foreign wars. They both want to bomb Libya. They both want to bomb Syria. They both want to bomb Afghanistan.

They both want to bomb Iraq. They both want to intervene. So these are, these are muscularly, militarily, strong political power. They both agree on free trade and free trade. Any, any competent economists will tell you that free trade, right? Almost everybody better off except the local people who lose their jobs in the transition.

And that's a lot of people. That's a lot of people sitting out there in the middle-class in the Midwest and the Roswell. So there is, there is a reallocation of wealth in free trade, even though you may be overall better off, there is a reallocation within constituencies and groups. So, and both parties agree that there should be no trouble.

That they should be able to hold office for as long as they want outside of the presidency, which is constitutionally restricted. Uh, both parties agree that they should take money from wealthy donors and they should be super PACS and there should be labor union contributions and all kinds of stuff like that.

So what, and both parties, you know, they, they actually are closer on the immigration stance than say Trump is. Um, so what you're ending up with is you're ending up with a scenario that, oh, uh, both parties agree. There should be no wealth. Both parties agree should be income taxes, income taxes keep up in a commerce down, but they keep the wealthy elite, but the wealth taxes hit the wealthy elite.

So you're ending up with a situation where the wealthy elite and it's not a formal conspiracy. Heck I'm part of it, right? Uh, Hmm. It's not a formal conspiracy, but because they send their kids to the right schools and they read the right magazines and go to the right cocktail parties and they make the right campaign contributions.

They flip the right people. They just ended up running it. And they ended up running the country for their benefit. And essentially the Republicans, the Democrats only differ on which elitist policies are. Uh, and the Democrats also have a very strong platform amongst the people who are sort of, uh, you know, maybe lower class by, by economic definition.

Um, and what you're finding is what made America great. Originally, I think was the middle-class. It has one of the strongest, largest middle classes in the. Uh, and income inequality and all those things have gotten more difficult. So now the question is, you know, what, what do you do? How do you, how can you change the parties?

And the reality is the parties aren't changing. The parties are passing around the presidency, like it's a crown or it's a sector. And you can tell that because a suspiciously, large number of the presidents all share the same last name. You know, we had a Bush, then we had another Bush. Then we were about to have a third one.

Well, what are the odds that out of 300 million people in the country that three of the 300 million most qualified to be present in a pure merit basis just happened to be from the same family? Uh, what are the odds that the best president happens to be a wife of the former president, so that I think people start to see, they start to realize that, yeah, this is not, the system is rigged.

There's a path dependence here, uh, who you are. And where you come from matters much more than what you can do. Uh, and so what you're seeing is, and so the presidency is a democratically elected office by the constitution. So it cannot be fully corrupted or taken over by and elite. And again, not a conspiracy, but just sort of a system that has formed.

Uh, and so in that system, the way it's protected though from the masses is by two things. One is it's really expensive to run. It costs billions of dollars. So if you cannot get billions of dollars, then you can't be president and therefore, and because you couldn't get billions of dollars without the elite supporting you all the presidential candidates are elitists.

So that's number one. Um, and number two is. You can't get the word out because the media is all owned by very rich individual. Yeah. It's complicit in, in, but again, not a formalized conspiracy sense. You could argue. Okay. Rupert Murdoch owns Fox. So it's complicit there, but also the implicit sense that journalists want to go to parties with rich people and they want to kiss up to them and they want to go, you know, and they, and they're sort of went to the same schools with them as well.

It's the same crew. Exactly. So those are the two, those are the two locks. Those are the two gates behind which the presidency was protected and the internet blew the whole thing up. And I think this is literally the last election in which we will see any elite candidates. So right now you're seeing two anti-elitist candidates who are Bernie and Trump who actually have a very similar platform with each other.

Trump is very liberal on social issues. Although he can't say that the Republican party, uh, Bernie is obviously very liberal on social issues, economic issues. They're actually both anti-trade, they're both anti bailout. They're both antiwar. They different immigration because Trump's voters think that jobs are a zero sum game and illegal immigrants are stealing their jobs.

And Bernie's voters think that money is a zero sum game. That wealth is a zero sum game and the rich stole their money. So they differ on the details, but they're actually much more aligned than they are separate, although they have completely different styles. Um, but the fascinating thing that's going on.

Yeah. Bernie is crowdfunding. That's probably the biggest news. Bernie has. Outraised Hillary, every step of the way. And he's done it with tiny checks from lots of small donors. That means that money in politics is dead. Now Trump is doing it by self-financing. Although he's about to switch over to donor or crowd financing, I don't know which one that'll be interesting to watch, but essentially the money barrier is down because.

Bernie can crowdfund or Trump can sell fund or Bloomberg can sell fund. And now the media barriers down because of social media. So the biggest news of this election, other than Bernie's crowdfunding has been how useless TV ads have been the TV ads. Haven't done a darn thing. And then on top, It doesn't matter what the mainstream media says.

The New York times, Vox Atlantic, they're screaming at the top of their lungs. The world will end if you elect Trump, you know, and everybody accepts salon is saying, the world will end. If you take Bernie over Hillary, he's unrealistic. He's a socialist. It's not going to work. And the voters aren't listening, all the passion and all the enthusiasm is with the insurgence.

It's with Bernie and. And so what you're going to see is this is just the beginning 2016 is the last election with the elites, even have a chance. I think starting in 2020, every major candidate will be crowdfunded. Every major candidate will be social media driven. There'll be Snapchat. It'll be Twitter.

It'll be Facebook. It'll be their Instagram. It'll be their successors. That will be driving the winners. Yeah. The thing that I really hope is going to happen. My personal hope is, again, I'm not that political. I think they're all crooks, to be honest, I think all of them are crooks. I don't want, I don't think any one human being should be ruling 300 million people and trying to tell them what to do.

It's just, there's two different, there's still people that just do different. Uh, so I'm more of a believer in federalism and local government, but anyway, that's, that's an aside. What I really hope will happen is we will start seeing transparency in politics. So who is going to be the first candidate who is going to basically say, you know what, instead of running it as a reality TV, I am going to turn this all into reality TV.

I'm going to wear a camera on me, 24 7. I'm going to televise every single meeting. So, you know, there's no corruption going on. So, you know, every time I'm talking to donors, what I'm saying, not just transcripts, but live streaming video, YouTube channel tune in watch the president 24 7. That's what I'm looking for.

The GoPro candidate. We're going to go pro on their head. But now you could say that's unrealistic. It's actually not. If it's a national security. Yeah. Just delay the tape by four years, wait till I'm out of office. So if I have to make a decision, do we go after Osama bin Laden over here or not? We'll still, we're still gonna record that meeting.

We're just going to release the uninterrupted uncensored video broadcast footage four years from now. Imagine what that does now. That means it's every time some secret trade deal is being negotiated, they can't in the backroom say, well, just do this for our constituency. Like while the American people are watching.

What do you want me to do for your constituency? Make the case to them. So it gets rid of all corruption in politics instantly. And I think we're going to see some of the populous candidates of the future running on this platform. Plus I think voters voters are watching Western west wing voters are watching house of cards.

They want to see the revolution, right? They want to see a tablet televised. They want to know what are you hiding from me, uh, at the end of the day, you know, if you look at. Uh, if you look at cops are wearing body cams, right. Cops who have to wear body cams and the stop and frisk searches. Well, OB obviously the people are better off because now the cop isn't going to beat up some poor person, you know, cause they look bad or get them or train them or, you know, it makes it harder for the cases where the cop shoots the black guy in the back.

Cause he's, you know, sands he's running away, but really it was set up right now, your body cams that helps right. It helps the cops too, because cops themselves have to worry about people, falsely suing them or accusing them. So it makes the system better for everybody. And what is the presidency? But the top.

The top cup should be wearing a body cam. Absolutely. If you give one monkey power over 300 million other monkeys, including the power to kill them, to torture them, to bomb them, to tax them, to drag them out of their homes, to make them rich, to make them into a living. God, if you give them that power, then of course you have to watch them.

You have to watch them work carefully, the new batch, anyone else. So I think that where this heads where I hope what I think this heads is crowdfund. Plus social media means that no more elite candidates, you will never see another Clinton or Bush run for office in the future. They're gone. Uh, you will not see any political dynasties in the future.

They'd gone. Um, but on top of that, I hope we will have tenancy. I hope we will have term limits. Um, and I think we're going to start seeing, uh, movements and platforms emerge within the parties that are. Uh, currently anti elite policies. We're going to see anti-religious policies becoming mainstream as scary for those of us we're elites.

And I've definitely in that category, but at the same time, I think it's a fascinating phenomenon to watch technology is taking us from being a Republic into being a true democracy. And that's a tough trend. Yeah, you S you know, absolutely fascinating. You say you're an elite, but you're really a revolutionary.

I've always told you. I have an underdog mentality is the problem, right? I think like an underdog, regardless of where, I mean, look what you've done in, in, in venture capital. I mean, the first phase there also was transparency. I remember not too many years ago. At least here in the New York ecosystem, when people used to come to me and say, Hey, someone offered me money, someone, you know, an entrepreneur, someone said this investor, he offered me some money.

He's going to invest my company. I would say, who, who are they? Yeah. See, I don't know. Yeah. I would say, look, there was no place to look them up. What deals have they been in? Speak to the other? Yeah. The entrepreneurs that, that, uh, he or she is backed. Well, I don't know. There was no way to do that. So the first layer of angel list was transparency.

Now let me tell you something. Now, the first question you say is, well, show me their Angeles portfolio. And they say, oh, okay. Then they go get it. And you say, oh, here it is. And then you go through it. You understand? You say, okay, they've invested in these companies. Let's go talk to the entrepreneurs that they've backed in.

And then we know something about them. So really that was the first layer, that trend. And if it keeps going, I mean, transparency is the way the world. Now, uh, you look at how transparent kids are, you know, privacy will exist, but we're heading into a completely different world. Uh, there will be no such thing as physical transparency because there'll be cameras, right.

The tech revolution is going to reduce the price of cameras to pennies. And just like, there's a digital watch everywhere. There'll be cameras everywhere. And our kids will be wearing cameras and the glasses, and they will have panels everywhere. So there will be no such thing as physical privacy that hasn't even sunk in yet.

But we're going to have is we'll have digital privacy thanks to encryption anonymity, but then people become monsters when they're anonymous online. Right. Just go like one of my big problems with being on social media. Broken every social media addiction now, except Twitter. And even that I would love to get away from, although I'm very addicted to it.

Uh, the, the problem with social media is people say all kinds of terrible things to other people online that they would never say to another human beings face. There's something about having that distance, that shield, that just allows kind of your inner monster to come out. Right? So the policy, I try to follow on Twitter, which I don't even follow all the time, but I try to, is, I will try not to say anything to anyone, Twitter that I wouldn't say to them.

If there were sitting right in here. Yeah, that said I'm a very outspoken noxious person. So I do say a lot of weird things to people sitting in front of me, but it's still quite different than what goes on on Twitter. I mean, I've gotten this habit now where otherwise very civilized people. I see them put out a tweet that I think is just like abusive against anyone, someone I just blocked them.

Like, I don't want to tell them, I mean, I don't know how much driving you do, but it's the same thing. You talk about shields people when they get behind the shield of that car. I mean, it's. I mean, if they did that on the street or waiting in line, just like elbowing you and knocking you over and cutting you off, I mean, would have fights breaking out all over the city.

Yeah, you're absolutely right. That is a great example of how, how anonymity in the real world turns otherwise civil human beings into monsters. It's a thin line. My friend, um, So listen, we're, we're catching you and I don't know how old you are early forties. Now this is the mellow philosophical wise wise, man.

Uh, let's go back to the origins. I do not, I do know that like this growing up. Yeah. Tell us a little about how you grew up in New York coming here. I think when you were nine years old to, to the U S. Yeah, we were, we were poor immigrants. Uh, my dad came here. He was a pharmacist in India, but his degree, uh, wasn't accepted here.

So he was in a hardware store. Uh, not a great upbringing, you know, family split up. Uh, but, but my mom, my mom. Gem and, you know, my dad meant well, so it all worked out okay. But essentially raised myself a lot. So I went to Stuyvesant, which was in a magnet school in New York city. It's, it's an amazing shining jewel of a school.

That's where I got my real education, uh, math science. And of course you really get educated by your peers. So inside of us, and I was surrounded by. Brilliant kids. Uh, very precocious. Um, after that went to Dartmouth, study, computer science and economics. Uh, and I wanted to be a scientist originally. I love science and I love books.

So I grew up reading a lot. Um, my mom used to use the library of the daycare center, which was fantastic. So I always had my nose buried in books and I want it to be a scientist. Uh, but you know, just having come from a background of. I wouldn't say extreme poverty, but definitely, definitely not. You know, not the elite side.

Uh, I was, I was also keen be cognizant that I wanted to take some, make some money. I want to take care of my family and mother and loved ones. And I just didn't want to be in a situation where a lack of money. Would create a suffering. So I definitely did grow up with an extremely underdog mentality, sort of the, the, you know, I'm going to do whatever it takes and I'm going to fight the world if I have to.

And I'll resist and I'm going to figure this out, I'm gonna solve this problem. Uh, and, uh, and so the intersection of science and money is. Uh, and, and I love technology. I love gadgets. Uh, so I came out to Silicon valley, um, joined a company here called home. Well, network didn't last long. I had never really had a boss for long, um, and, uh, went and started my own companies.

And one was, uh, helped some guys start an optical amplifier company, helping other guys start a 3d graphics company, which then spun out keyhole systems, which got sold to Google. It's not Google earth. Uh, then I started opinions, which was my doctor. Uh, which would have done well, except that it was during the crash.

So there was a merger, there was a fiasco, and then there was a, there was a lawsuit because we won't get into it, but yes, yes. Yeah. It's ancient history. I'm over that, but it was the time when I was struggling to, uh, you know, quote unquote be successful. Uh, and then after a while, you know, I broke out of that and I just re and I started just taking over.

I became a lot more independent after that. Probably the best thing that happened to me. Uh, I would say all the great things in life come from suffering, right? Because you're never gonna do anything different than what you're doing now until you really suffer. Uh, one of my favorite philosophers has this great insight where he says suffering is that moment.

When you see everything the way you see things, the way they actually are, you can no longer deny it. You can no longer say or know, she still loves me, or he still loves me. You can no longer say, oh, I still have the money. I'm still going to win. Or I'm still going to be healthy. Suffering is when it is.

When you see reality, the way that it truly is. And so when you see that, then you change. And so I've been fortunate and unfortunate because they'll just go together enough to suffer a few times in my life. Uh, you know, once over money, once over love, once over feeling like, uh, you know, I had built something, but yet still lost everything.

And the beauty of those, uh, experiences is that they make you much more confident in who you are and what you want. As opposed to what the world has been telling you this whole time that you should want. Uh, and so somewhere, uh, you know, the greatest gift to me was somewhere around 2005. Uh, I just became completely independent, uh, and, and not in a financial way, but in a way where I just said to myself, I'm going to decide what's best for myself, and I will take other people's inputs.

Uh, and I will see what the world has to teach me and offer. But at the end of the day, there are. Mentors advisors, superiors adults. Everyone's making it up as they go along. And it's different for everybody. The answer is different for everybody yet. It's like, you know, when you're young, when you're, when you're a child, you ask questions like, Hey mom, what's the meaning of life?

Is it really a Santa Claus? What happens when we die for, yeah. And mom says, Don't ask those questions. They don't have answers, right? It's too painful. As you get older, you start asking questions like, well, who do I marry? And am I going to make money? And what do I do? And all that stuff. And those are decent questions and they can have answers.

But I actually think those original questions you asked them, the child, those are actually the most interesting questions. And the reason to ask those questions again as an adult is because it turns out they do have answers. Everyone has a different answer. It's a personal answer. Meaning of life does have an answer it's different for everybody and you have to figure it out yourself.

Uh, you know, what are my values? Uh, you know, whoa, why am I working hard? Why should I struggle? Is happiness important? Uh, to me, how do I find peace? You know, those kinds of things is there, death, is there a God, all those questions should be asked, but they should be asked personally and quietly and your answer doesn't apply to other people.

It's your own, it's your own answer. So when I got into this mode of realizing that I was truly independent and truly alone in this. Because you come into this world alone and you leave alone and all you do is you kind of communicate through these very hazy words and boundaries, trying to get emotionally connected to another human being, but you're fundamentally alone in it.

And that's both the beauty and the tragedy of it. Uh, and you know, no one else can see and feel what you have seen. It felt from your point of view and no one ever will. And that's a beautiful, but if you, if you view that as I'm lonely, it can also be tragic. But in my case, I took it as a source of strength and power.

Uh, and I used that to say, I'm just going to figure everything out from my. So, yeah, so venture hacks was figuring out how to negotiate VC terms for myself, and then tell them to the world, even though people said, maybe you shouldn't be doing that. Uh, angel list was about saying, well, okay. The world today, hordes is deals and, and highly instinctual founders.

What if we just opened all that up? Even the recruiting side of it. It's free. We exposed salaries. We pose equity. We expose equity. We do direct matching and there are no recruiters involved. We break so many rules about the recruiting business. That's what people don't realize. What's unique about angel list is we break assumptions that other people just accept.

So of course, that's going to lead to criticize. But how else are you going to discover what's new and how else are you going to discover what works for the world? So even in my politics, you know, I break assumptions. You can find me extreme left in certain situations. Like, I don't think there should be private ownership of property.

Like I think the concept is a fiction. Uh, you know, the idea that you own a piece of land because your great grandfather got there first weapon. And now you get to sit in that land forever. I mean, that's, that, that seems very outmoded to me. Uh, I mean by that, right. You know, there should be probably some native Americans who have a right and so on.

So essentially all private property, uh, rests on violence, uh, deep down that said I'm a staunch capitalist, right? Uh, I think capitalism is the economic equivalent of evolution. It is a competitive system. It is a brutal system, but it's a system that works. Same with evolution. It's a competitive system.

It's a brutal system as anyone who's watching this just show, but it works. But at the same time, we're now entering an era of technology where, uh, we are entering massive abundance. I can create iPhones and Android phones all day long for 50 bucks, a pop and put supercomputers in people's pockets. And we can probably create infinite food and infinite housing over the next a hundred years.

But at the same time, we're also creating weaponry that is unimaginably powerful. We're going to have bumblebee sized, drones and GPS and face tracking that can fly up people's nostrils and blow up. I mean, so it's assassinations and they become really easy nuclear weapons. I mean, that proliferation is out of control.

So we're also increasing the destructive power of the human species without bound as. As we get better and better with technology and science. So this is exactly what good a rep referred to in Faust. It is the fast in bargain with the devil. It's the Adam and Eve apple story. You buy the tree from the, you bite the apple from the fruit of knowledge, and guess what?

You fall out of paradise. It's literally written into our oldest legends. So I think as a human species, we have to figure out how to evolve from our evolutionary and capitalistic origins, which are ingrained into our biology, into. Uh, more of a Unitarian, not, I don't wanna use the word communist, cause I'm not a communist, but more of a conscious society where we learn to live with each other and every human at some point, not this generation, not, not anytime soon, but every human has to become a pacifist before one human can become a nihilist.

So my politics are way out in left field. I'm extremely left and extremely right on certain things, uh, in the class of context. Right? Uh, it it's it's it's, uh, it's it's many contradictions and yet it's not a jumble. You've you, you tie it all together. Let me ask you this. From your sort of orchestral view in the middle of angel list and this ecosystem that's swirling around you seeing all these companies forming and growing and scaling, et cetera.

Are you hopeful? Um, what, uh, how do you S you know, what, what does this perch that you have? What insights does it. I am extremely hopeful. I think technology is doing beautiful things. Uh, you know, the founders that are coming up, they're conscious, they're hardworking. Uh, they have, they want to do more than just money.

There are better people than I was when I was an entrepreneur, because I was just too focused on money. I think the new generation is far more conscious than I am. And it's good, you know, w we should, I think it was Ben Franklin who said, like, you know, I want to study war on politics that my children can study a business, so their children can study science.

Their children can study art music, right. So every generation should be becoming more conscious. So that's a good trend line. The technology that we're building now. Is going to make every material goods, so abundant and every service. So abundant, uh, that, you know, it's a, it's overall a great thing. Uh, and you can see like how Uber and Lyft and others are changing.

The whole transportation game. Self-driving cars are gonna change the transportation game, uh, electric cars, uh, you know, a Bitcoin is going to do for money and finance and for contracts. Well, and, you know, do it with legions of like lawyers and paperwork and wire transfer. Big banks. Um, so there's a lot to be hopeful for.

Uh, I think there's a lot more to be hopeful for that to not be hopeful for. And social media is taking over the presidency. I know this is the Twitter election. That's what people, you know, are not really fundamentally understanding yet. There's Twitter, the company, but Twitter. Yeah, it's huge Twitter. The dream is that for the first time in human history, one person can stand up and instantly broadcast anything to all of humanity before their sensor.

That is unimaginable. That is unimaginable even 30 years ago. Any, any, uh, revolutionary who was fired up. Taking over the media should now be like, you know, embarrassed. So there's a great south park episode. I forget those guys were brilliant, but they were basically talking about something horrible was happening and they have to get the word out.

So Stan, and kind of like, okay, I'm going to call the news. We're going to go and talk to the reporters. Okay. I'm going to write an article for the school newspaper. Okay. I'm going to rally a mob and we're going to get together and go to city hall, staff steps and corporate says, oh, And they all stop. He's like, oh, I got a thousand retweets.

It's gone viral. It's trending. It's the number one hashtag. Right, right. So that is incredible. I mean, the fact that technology has gotten us into a place now where literally everybody is a broadcast all times and really full credit to Jack Dorsey and Evan Williams and Noah, and the whole team at Twitter for having invented that.

But, uh, you know, you look at YouTube, anyone can broadcast. Uh, the reason I called my piece American spring was because the Arab spring was driven by technology and the American spring is no different Trump and Bernie Sanders are driven by technology too. You take away Twitter, you take away Facebook, you take away crowdfunding, you would shut Bernie and Trump down tomorrow, but you cannot take those things away.

The fastest way to have an actual physical revolution in the streets is try and take our phones. That's the part that the FBI doesn't understand when they're trying to push for back doors and encryption, encryption back doors would actually destroy the tech industry and you would have to buy the freedom of speech because I can put an encryption code or I, them on my, on my t-shirt.

How you gonna stop that? Right. Uh, and open it. So w what I think this eventually heads is, I think we, through technology businesses and innovation, we're going to build amazing things to help the world, uh, you know, by my co-founder, Nivi always says startups are here to save the world. He's even more messianic in that sense, but I think he's right, but I think on a long, long time scale, now we're talking, you know, 20, 30, 50 years.

I think what happens is more and more of these services will become open source. And right now, today in the open source movement, we only have software, but if you go and you look at something like Blockstack, which is actually based out in New York, they're using BitTorrent and the blockchain and distributed file systems and encryption to build fully autonomous living services and pieces of code and platforms that are open.

So imagine a piece of software that literally has a piece of code in there that hires. Engineers with bounties to reprogram itself. And it lives in a distributed file system, encrypted across thousands of machines, and it pays in Bitcoin to stay alive and to get better. And it collects Bitcoin with a built in business model.

These distributed autonomous organizations are going to be the first AIS, but they're not going to be AI in the sense that they pass the Turing test, but they're gonna be AI in the sense that they're autonomous entities. They might be self-driving cars that work for them. So they drive around paying charging stations and charging you Bitcoin and they're paying mechanics and getting repairs.

So it's like at what point do you start drawing a distinction between autonomy and intelligence? So we're going to have these kinds of entities emerging and they're going to create wealth and abundance for all of humanity. The problem today is that it's just very unevenly district. Very unevenly distributed, right?

Because the people who are not technically literate are being left behind. So I actually think one of the greatest charitable things we can do today is, is figure out how to retrain. To get comfortable with technology because the computer is the most powerful tool for creativity. The most powerful force multiplier invented since the stone ax, but where you don't need another human's permission to use it because every other tool that we've invented since that had a lot of impact and gave people, leverage like factories and printing press and all that you needed other people to give you permission to.

What technology that's not true. So that's kind of how I reconcile, you know, what am I doing with Angeles? I'm trying to push the technology both forward and I'm trying to pull, push it forward in the best way that I know how, and the best way that I know is by helping every great entrepreneur realize their dream.

And I can't do it for all of them. And I can't do it manually. It doesn't scale, but I can build a platform and an infrastructure and a community that helps move it. Right. Novel, absolutely stunning. So illuminating so much fun. It's really a privilege. We'll have you back on next year. I can't. Thank you enough.

Thank you so much for letting me ramble on all kinds of thank yous and thank you, my friend be well.
