I like Venture Capital. I really do. And even in the current bubble, [Vijay, the World’s Most Desperate Venture Capitalist](http://www.dilbert.com/comics/dilbert/archive/images/dilbert2005152631215.gif) is a little exaggerated.

But what am I supposed to do when I put [a job posting](http://www.craigslist.org/sfc/eng/124054534.html) on Craigslist and get the following response?

“My name is XXXX XXXX, and I am a Principal with XXXXX, a venture capital firm based in XXXXXXXX. I learned about your startup on Craig’s List. My firm manages just north of XXX million in active funds. We invest in early-stage software and Internet companies, and I would be interested in learning more about your project.”

You can’t make this stuff up.

Actually, I have to hand it to the guy. One of the three things you need to succeed in Venture Capital is proprietary deal-flow (the other two are access to capital and good judgement). By hitting Craigslist early, these guys are doing legwork that others eschew – they’re hunting for the next Skype actively rather then putting their feet up on Mahogany desks and waiting for the deals to come pouring in. Welcome!
