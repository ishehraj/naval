I know I haven’t posted recently, but I have been busy! [Nivi](http://www.nivi.com/blog) and I are launching a new site called [Venture Hacks](http://www.venturehacks.com/), an entrepreneur’s guide to hacking Venture Capital. It’s a “tell all” site that helps entrepreneurs get on an even footing with their better-informed counterparts when negotiating an investment.

Read all about it [here](http://www.nivi.com/blog/article/introducing-venture-hacks).
