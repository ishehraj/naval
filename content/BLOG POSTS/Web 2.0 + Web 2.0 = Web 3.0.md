"We’re a movin’ on up,  
(We’re a movin on up.)  
To the east side.  
(Mo-vin on up.)  
To a de-luxe apartment,  
In the sky-.  
Mo-vin’ on up  
(Mo-vin on up.)  
To the east side,  
(Mo-vin on up.)  
We finally got a piece of the pie."

That’s right, Vast.com is moving! If you have a Web 2.0 company somewhere in SOMA or Mission and would like to sublease about 2000-3000 square feet of space, please contact me at [myfirstname]@[mylastname].[com]. We’d prefer something well lit, near to shops / restaurants, etc., and populated with interesting people.
