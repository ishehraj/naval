A caucasian and U.S. born friend once opined that I was lucky to have been born in a great culture (India), and that Americans have no culture. Not so. She has been living in it for so long that she is a fish in the American cultural ocean – it’s invisible. People leave the world in droves to come to America, for the culture. The culture of freedom, individual liberty, open-ness, and protection from the [greatest slaughterer of mankind](http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2005/11/democide.html), government. I’ll take that any day over colorful clothing and spicy food.
