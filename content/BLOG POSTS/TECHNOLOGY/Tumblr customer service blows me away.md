> Â Hi, Naval. Tumblr doesnâ€™t allow the creation of a custom RSS feed address. You might try burning your Tumblr feed in FeedBurner, using FeedBurnerâ€™s MyBrand feature to associate the burned feed with your custom domain, and then editing the Custom HTML of your Tumblr theme to point browsers/RSS readers to the RSS feed from FeedBurner MyBrand rather than to Tumblrâ€™s default RSS feed.
