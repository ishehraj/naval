PART I - BUILDING JUDGMENT 

There’s no shortcut to smart.

If you want to make the maximum amount of money possible, if you want to get rich over your life in a deterministically predictable way, stay on the bleeding edge of trends and study technology, design, and art—become really good at something. [1] 

You don’t get rich by spending your time to save money. 

You get rich by saving your time to make money. 

Hard work is really overrated. How hard you work matters a lot less in the modern economy. 

What is underrated? 

Judgment. Judgment is underrated. [1] 

Can you define judgment? 

My definition of wisdom is knowing the long-term consequences of your actions. Wisdom applied to external problems is judgment. They’re highly linked; knowing the long-term consequences of your actions and then making the right decision to capitalize on that. [78] 

In an age of leverage, one correct decision can win everything.

Without hard work, you’ll develop neither judgment nor leverage. 

You have to put in the time, but the judgment is more important. The direction you’re heading in matters more than how fast you move, especially with leverage.  Picking the direction you’re heading in for every decision is far, far more important than how much force you apply. Just pick the right direction to start walking in, and start walking. [1]
