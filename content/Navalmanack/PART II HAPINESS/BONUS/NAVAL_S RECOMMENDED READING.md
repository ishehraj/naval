 NONFICTION

[**The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World**](https://amzn.to/2ZJl30S) by David Deutsch  
Not the easiest read, but it made me smarter. [79]

[**Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind**](https://amzn.to/2HXS81r) by Yuval Noah Harari  
A history of the human species. The observations, frameworks, and mental models will have you looking at history and your fellow humans differently. [1]

_Sapiens_ is the best book of the last decade I have read. He had decades to write Sapiens. There are lots of great ideas in there and it’s just full of them, chock-full per page. [1]

[**The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves**](https://amzn.to/2MRaAaN) by Matt Ridley  
The most brilliant and enlightening book I’ve read in years. He has written four of my top twenty books. [11]

Everything else written by Matt Ridley. Matt is a scientist, optimist, and forward thinker. One of my favorite authors. I’ve read everything of his, and reread everything of his. [4]

**→** [**Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters**](https://amzn.to/2GtO32n)→ [**The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature**](https://amzn.to/2E91aEw)→ [**The Origins of Virtue: Human Instincts and the Evolution of Cooperation**](https://amzn.to/2E7Htgn)**→** [**The Evolution of Everything: How New Ideas Emerge**](https://amzn.to/2EaihGf)

[**Skin in the Game**](https://amzn.to/2WJHiPH) by Nassim Taleb

The best book I read in 2018, I highly recommend it. Lots of great ideas in there. Lots of good mental models and constructs. He has a bit of an att itude, but he has that because he’s brilliant, and it’s okay. So just look past the att itude and read the book, learn the concepts. It’s one of the best business books I’ve ever read. And luckily, it doesn’t masquerade as a business book. [10]

[**The Bed of Procrustes: Philosophical and Practical Aphorisms**](https://amzn.to/2GU56fg) by Nassim Taleb This is his collection of ancient wisdom. He is also famous for [The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable](https://amzn.to/2tLvqiV), [Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder](https://amzn.to/2HQUZqd)_,_ and [Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and Markets](https://amzn.to/2tKMXro)_,_ all of which are worth reading. [7]

[**Six Easy Pieces: Essentials of Physics Explained by Its Most Brilliant Teacher**](https://amzn.to/2SO3jxF) by Richard Feynman  
I would give my kids a copy of Richard Feynman’s _Six Easy Pieces and_ [Six Not-So-Easy Pieces: Einstein’s Relativity, Symmetry, and Space](https://amzn.to/2EbxUgz). Richard Feynman is a famous physicist. I love both his demeanor as well as his understanding of physics.

I’ve also been reading [Perfectly Reasonable Deviations from the Beaten Track](https://amzn.to/2UcFuNG) by Feynman and rereading [Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman](https://amzn.to/2tNmMQV), a biography about him. [8]

[**The Thing Explainer: Complicated Stuff in Simple Words**](https://amzn.to/2GooAIt) by Randall Munroe  
A great book by Randall Munroe (creator of _xkcd_, a very science-oriented webcomic). In this book, he explains very complicated concepts, all the way from climate change to physical systems to submarines while only using the thousand most common words in the English language. He called the Saturn Five rocket “Up Goer Five.” You can’t define a rocket as a spaceship or a rocket. It’s self-referential. He says “up goer.” It’s this thing that goes up. Kids get it right away. [4]

[**Thinking Physics: Understandable Practical Reality**](https://amzn.to/2Go8zCp) by Lewis Carroll Epstein There’s another great book called _Thinking Physics_. I open this one all the time. I love on the back cover how it has this great little pitch that says, “The only book used in both grade school and graduate school.” It’s true. It’s all simple physics puzzles that can be explained to a twelve-year-old child and can be explained to a twenty-five-year-old grad student in physics. They all have fundamental insights in physics. They’re all kind of tricky, but anyone can get to the answer through purely logical reasoning. [4]

[**The Lessons of History**](https://amzn.to/2Cb3yJV) by Will and Ariel Durant  
This is a great book I really like that summarizes some of the larger themes of history; it’s very incisive. And unlike most history books, it’s actually really small, and it covers a lot of ground. [7]

[**The Sovereign Individual: Mastering the Transition to the Information Age**](https://amzn.to/2GFBEZw) by James Dale Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg  
This is the best book I’ve read since _Sapiens_ (far less mainstream, though).

[**Poor Charlie’s Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger**](https://amzn.to/2SNxJQB) by Charlie Munger (edited by Peter Kaufman)  
This masquerades as a business book, but it’s really just Charlie Munger (of Berkshire Hathaway)’s advice on overcoming oneself to live a successful and virtuous life. [7] [80]

[**Reality Is Not What It Seems: The Journey to Quantum Gravity**](https://amzn.to/2SQta8d) by Carlo Rovelli  
This is the best book I’ve read in the last year. Physics, poetry, philosophy, and history packaged in a very accessible form.

[**Seven Brief Lessons in Physics**](https://amzn.to/2EaZLO9) by Carlo Rovelli  
I’ve read this one at least twice.

For game theory, in addition to playing strategy games, you may want to try [The Compleat Strategyst: Being a Primer on the Theory of Games of Strategy](https://amzn.to/2TPkWuj) by J.D. Williams and [The Evolution of Cooperation](https://amzn.to/2N6avzV) by Robert Axelrod. [11]

### PHILOSOPHY AND SPIRITUALITY

Everything by Jed McKenna

Jed spits raw truth. His style may be off-putting, but the dedication to truth is unparalleled. [79]

[Theory of Everything (The Enlightened Perspective) - Dreamstate Trilogy](https://amzn.to/2zXjldF)

[Jed McKenna’s Notebook](https://amzn.to/34tRr6Y)

[Jed Talks #1](https://amzn.to/2ZA275n) and [_#2_](https://amzn.to/2PPcwFO)

Everything by Kapil Gupta, MD

Kapil recently became a personal advisor and coach to me, and this comes from a person who doesn’t believe in coaches. [79]

→ [A Master’s Secret Whispers: For those who abhor noise and seek The Truth about life and living](https://amzn.to/2PQ4lsU)  
→ [Direct Truth: Uncompromising, non-prescriptive Truths to the enduring questions of life](https://amzn.to/2ZV1qyE)  
→ [Atmamun: The Path to achieving the bliss of the Himalayan Swamis. And the freedom of a living God.](https://amzn.to/311Fpj7) 

[**The Book of Life**](https://amzn.to/2V1TzgZ) by Jiddu Krishnamurti  
Krishnamurti is a lesser-known guy, an Indian philosopher who lived at the turn of the last century and is extremely infl uential to me. He’s an uncompromising, very direct person who basically tells you to look at your own mind at all times. I have been hugely infl uenced by him. Probably the best book is _The Book of Life_, which is excerpts from his various speeches and books stitched together. [6]

I’ll give my kids a copy of The Book of Life. I’ll tell them to save it until they’re older because it won’t make much sense while they’re younger. [8]

[**Total Freedom: The Essential Krishnamurti**](https://amzn.to/2BAkclP) by Jiddu Krishnamurti  
I like this for someone who’s more advanced. A rationalist’s guide to the perils of the human mind. The “spiritual” book I keep returning to. [1]

[**Siddhartha**](https://amzn.to/2BAjKnD) by Herman Hesse  
I love this as a classic book on philosophy, a good introduction for someone starting out. I’ve given out more copies of this book than any other. [1]

> ## I’m pretty much always rereading something by either Krishnamurti or Osho. Those are my favorite philosophers. [4]

[Update: I’d now add Jed McKenna, Kapil Gupta, the Vashistha Yoga, and Schopenhauer to that list.]

[**The Book of Secrets: 112 Meditations to Discover the Mystery Within**](https://amzn.to/2DFbqDn) by Osho  
Most meditation techniques are concentration methods, and there are many, many meditation techniques. If you want to run through a bunch of them, you can pick up a book called _The Book of Secrets_ by Osho. I know he’s gotten a bad rap recently, but he was a pretty smart guy. It’s actually a translation of an old Sanskrit book with 112 different meditations. You can try each one and see which one works for you. [74]

[**The Great Challenge: Exploring the World Within**](https://amzn.to/2UVYsYD) by Osho

  
[**The Way to Love: The Last Meditations of Anthony DeMello**](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/way-to-love-anthony-de-mello/1119833741#/) by Anthony DeMello

  
[**The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself**](https://amzn.to/2GDCuWC) by Michael Singer

  
[**Meditations**](https://amzn.to/2GqEIZX) _by_ Marcus Aurelius  
Marcus Aurelius was absolutely life-changing for me. It’s the personal diary of the emperor of Rome. Here’s a guy who was probably the most powerful human being on Earth at the time he lived. He’s writing a diary to himself, never expecting it to be published. When you open this book, you realize he had all the same issues and all the same mental struggles; he was trying to be a bett er person. Right there, you fi gure out success and power don’t improve your internal state—you still have to work on it. [6]

[**Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends on It**](https://amzn.to/2BAmFwi) on It by Kamal Ravikant  
I’ve actually been reading my brother’s book, _Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends on It_. I thought it was very succinctly written. (Obviously a plug for my bro.)

He’s the philosopher in the family—I’m just the amateur. He has a great line in his book:  

> ## I once asked a monk how he found peace. “I say ‘yes,’” he’d said. “To all that happens, I say ‘yes.’” [7]

[**The Tao of Seneca: Practical Letters from a Stoic Master**](https://www.audible.com/series?asin=B01AKQ5F1M)My most listened-to audiobook. The most important audiobook I've ever heard. 

[**How to Change your Mind**](https://amzn.to/2WZYCjw) by Michael Pollanby Michael Pollan  
There’s a good book Michael Pollan wrote recently called _How to Change Your Mind,_ and I think it is a brilliant book everybody should read. T

he book discusses psychedelics. Psychedelics are a bit of a cheat code in self-observation. I don’t recommend drugs for anybody—you can do it all through pure meditation. If you want to accelerate ahead, you know, psychedelics are good for that. [74]

[**Striking Thoughts: Bruce Lee’s Wisdom for Daily Living**](https://amzn.to/2TPfUxV) by Bruce Lee  
Oddly enough, Bruce Lee wrote some great philosophy, and _Striking Thoughts_ is a good summary of some of his philosophy.

[**The Prophet**](https://amzn.to/2C0KYUp) by Kahlil Gibran  
This book reads like a modern-day poetic religious tome. It’s up there with the Bhagavad Gita, the _Tao Te Ching_, the Bible, and the Qur’an. It is written in the style where it has a feel of religiosity and truth, but it was very approachable, beautiful, nondenominational, and nonsectarian. I loved this book.

He has a gift for poetically describing what children are like, what lovers are like, what marriage should be like, how you should treat your enemies and your friends, how you should work with money, what can you think of every time you have to kill something to eat it. I felt it, like the great religious books, gave a very deep, very philosophical, but very true answer to how to approach the major problems in life. I recommend _The Prophet_ to anybody, whether you’re religious or not. Whether you are Christian, Hindu, Jewish, or atheist. I think it’s a beautiful book, and it’s worth reading. [7]

[**The Tao of Philosophy**](https://amzn.to/2XyjrD1) by Alan Watts [7]

### SCIENCE FICTION  

> ## [I started with comic books and sci-fi. Then I was into history and news. Then into psychology, popular science, technology.](https://ctt.ac/ZJRY5)

[**Ficciones**](https://amzn.to/2Gqz5eC) by Jorge Luis Borges  
I love Jorge Luis Borges, an Argentine author. His short story collection _Ficciones_, or [Labyrinths](https://amzn.to/2XnDCn1), is amazing. Borges is probably still the most powerful author I have read who wasn’t just outright writing philosophy. There was philosophy in there with the sci-fi. [1]

[**Stories of Your Life and Others**](https://amzn.to/2Goqd93) by Ted Chiang  
My current favorite sci-fi short story: probably “Understand” by Ted Chiang. It’s in a collection called _Stories of Your Life and Others_. “Story of Your Life” was made into a movie called Arrival. [1]

[**Exhalation: Stories**](https://amzn.to/2GpklMK) by Ted Chiang  
This contemplates the marvel of thermodynamics from the best sci-fi short story writer of our age.

[**The Lifecycle of Software Objects**](https://amzn.to/2V1V8eR) by Ted Chiang  
Another masterpiece of sci-fi by Ted Chiang

[**Snow Crash**](https://amzn.to/2UX71SZ) by Neal Stephenson  
_Snow Crash_ is an amazing, amazing book. There’s nothing quite similar to Snow Crash. Snow Crash is in a league of its own. Stephenson also wrote [The Diamond Age.](https://amzn.to/2SNNA1O)

[**The Last Question**](https://amzn.to/33aiROo) by Isaac Asimov   
I quote _The Last Question_ all of the time. I loved it as a kid. 

**What are the books you’re rereading now?**

That’s a good question. I’ll pull up my Kindle app as we talk. Usually, I’m always rereading some books in science.

I’m reading a book on René Girard’s mimetic theory. It’s more of an overview book, because I couldn’t make it through his actual writings. I’m reading [Tools of Titans](https://amzn.to/2UX9w7P), Tim Ferriss’s book of what he learned from a lot of great performers.

I’m reading a book, [Thermoinfocomplexity](https://amzn.to/32aWtmF). It’s actually by a friend of mine, Behzad Mohit. I just finished reading [Pre-Suasion: A Revolutionary Way to Influence and Persuade](https://amzn.to/2GuSU4v), or I should say I just finished skimming Pre-Suasion by Robert Cialdini. I don’t think I needed to read the entire book to get the point, but it was still good to read what I did. It’s a great little history book. I’m currently reading [The Story of Philosophy: The Lives and Opinions of the Great Philosophers](https://amzn.to/2E92nMi), also by Will Durant. 

I have a young kid now, so I’ve got a lot of child-rearing books I use more as reference material than anything else. I recently read some Emerson and some Chesterfield. I have a Leo Tolstoy book here. 

[Alan Watts](https://amzn.to/2X2fWEL). [Scott Adams](https://amzn.to/2Eb3hIl). I reread [God’s Debri_s_](https://amzn.to/2E7XKlr) recently. [Tao Te Ching](https://amzn.to/2EaO4Xz), a friend of mine is rereading it, so I picked it up again. There’s tons. I mean, I could go on and on. There’s Nietzsche’s book here. There’s [The Undercover Economist](https://amzn.to/2UW0PdZ)_._ [The Richard Bach book](https://amzn.to/2X009WO) [_Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah_]. There’s some Jed McKenna books. 

A little [Dale Carnegie](https://amzn.to/2E8UshX) in here. [The Three-Body Problem](https://amzn.to/2E9dZ1W) [Cixin Liu]_._ [Man’s Search for Meanin_g_](https://amzn.to/2UWcYj9) _[Victor E. Frankl]_. There’s lots. [Sex at Dawn](https://amzn.to/2X42AHR) [Christopher Ryan]. There’s a lot of books out there.

By the way, when I tell people what I’m reading, I skip two thirds of my books. The reason I skip two-thirds is because they’re embarrassing. They don’t sound like good books to read. They’ll sound trivial or silly. Who cares? I don’t have to tell everybody everything I read. I read all kinds of stuff other people consider junk or even reprehensible. I read all kinds of stuff I disagree with because they’re mind-bending. [4]

> ## I always spent money on books. I never viewed that as an expense. That’s an investment to me. [4]

[**The Day You Became A Better Writer**](https://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html) by Scott Adams  
Even though I am a very good writer and I’ve been writing a lot since I was young, I still open up that blog post and put it in the background anytime I’m writing anything important. It’s that good. I use it as my basic template for how to write well. Think about the title, “The Day You Became a Better Writer.” It’s such a powerful title. He teaches you in one small blog post the importance of surprise, the importance of headlines, the importance of being brief and directed, not using some adjectives and adverbs, using active not the passive voice, etc. This one blog post right there will change your writing style forever if you put your ego down and absorb it properly. [6]

Must read. (Twitter thread on “[intellectual compounding](https://twitter.com/zaoyang/status/940409514875961344)” by @Zaoyang). [11]

There are actually some really good graphic novels out there. If you’re open to the cartoony element of it, [_Transmetropolitan_](https://amzn.to/2ByLYyQ)_,_ [_The Boys_](https://amzn.to/2E7ZkUp)_,_ [_Planetary_](https://amzn.to/2SNK4UT), and [_The Sandman_](https://amzn.to/2E8sdjn) ... some of these are, I think, among the finest works of art of our age. I also grew up as a boy reading comics, so I may be very biased towards those. [1]

[**Rick and Morty**](https://amzn.to/2N7427M) (TV Show + Comic book)  
Rick and Morty is the best show on television (IMHO, of course). Just watch the first episode—that’s all it takes. It’s _Back to the Future_ meets _The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy._

_The Rick and Morty_ comic [by Zac Gorman] is just as clever as the show.

**“**[**You and Your Research**](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html)**”** by Richard Hamming  
A beautiful essay, I highly recommend reading it. It’s ostensibly written for people who are in scientific research, but I think it applies across the board. It’s just an old-timer essay on how to do great work. It reminds me of much of what Richard Feynman used to say, although I think Hamming has put it more eloquently than almost anywhere else I’ve seen. [74]
