LIFE FORMULAS I (2008) 

These are notes to myself. Your frame of reference, and therefore your calculations, may vary. These are not definitions—these are algorithms for success. Contributions are welcome. 

→ Happiness = Health + Wealth + Good Relationships 

→ Health = Exercise + Diet + Sleep 

→ Exercise = High Intensity Resistance Training + Sports + Rest 

→ Diet = Natural Foods + Intermittent Fasting + Plants 

→ Sleep = No alarms + 8–9 hours + Circadian rhythms 

→ Wealth = Income + Wealth * (Return on Investment) 

→ Income = Accountability + Leverage + Specific Knowledge 

→ Accountability = Personal Branding + Personal Platform + Taking Risk? 

→ Leverage = Capital + People + Intellectual Property 

→ Specific Knowledge = Knowing how to do something society cannot yet easily train other people to do 

→ Return on Investment = “Buy-and-Hold” + Valuation + Margin of Safety [72]
